#
# Story: E28-S203 — Fix SKILL.md ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../scripts/ -> /scripts/
# path typo in 11 skills.
#
# Context: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} is set by Claude Code when it loads the plugin
# and already points at plugins/gaia/ (the directory containing
# .claude-plugin/plugin.json). Helper scripts live INSIDE that plugin root at
# scripts/<helper>.sh — so every path reference from a SKILL.md MUST be
# ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/<helper>.sh. The pattern
# ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../scripts/<helper>.sh is malformed: it climbs one
# directory above the plugin root, where scripts/ does not exist, and every LLM
# invocation that follows the prose fails with "no such file or directory"
# before the LLM self-corrects.
#
# This guard scans every SKILL.md under plugins/gaia/skills/*/ and fails if the
# malformed ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../scripts/ pattern reappears. On failure it
# prints each offending file and line so the regression is trivial to locate.
