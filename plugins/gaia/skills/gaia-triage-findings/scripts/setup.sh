# sidecar write. Setup never created the sentinel, so the gate was
# fail-closed-unusable: any invocation with the sentinel-required flag set
# halted at finalize with "Val sidecar write missing".
#
# This block writes the sentinel at run-start so finalize can assert
# correctly: setup creates the .json marker NOW; finalize asserts that
# any subsequent sidecar write has mtime > sentinel mtime. The sentinel
# itself is a minimal JSON payload identifying the run.
# Canonical .gaia/memory/checkpoints only; legacy _memory probe removed.
# Env CHECKPOINT_PATH override wins.
