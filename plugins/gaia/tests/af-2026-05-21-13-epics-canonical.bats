# Regression coverage for AF-2026-05-21-13: /gaia-create-epics and
# /gaia-add-stories SKILL.md prose hardcoded legacy docs/planning-artifacts/
# and docs/test-artifacts/ literals. The LLM, when writing artifacts via the
# Write tool, used the prose-named legacy paths. Greenfield + post-ADR-111
# projects landed artifacts in rogue docs/ directories.
#
# Note: The scripts (gaia-create-epics/scripts/finalize.sh and
# gaia-add-stories/scripts/setup.sh) ALREADY implement an E96-S7 partial-4c
# canonical-first two-tier smart-fallback — they read from canonical first
# and fall back to legacy only when canonical is absent. The bug surface
# was ONLY in the SKILL.md prose. This fixture verifies (a) the SKILL.md
# prose canonical assertion and (b) the existing canonical-first script
# resolution remains intact (regression guard against drift).
