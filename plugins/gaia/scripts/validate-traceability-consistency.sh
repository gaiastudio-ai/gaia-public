# validate-traceability-consistency.sh — traceability ↔ story-registry consistency audit
#
# Purpose:
#   Detect a class of silent corruption that the framework had no integrity
#   check for: a traceability matrix that references story keys whose scope is
#   inconsistent with the canonical story registry (epics-and-stories.md).
#
#   A cascade sub-agent that regenerates a traceability story-detail section
#   can derive its story keys by sequentially numbering the things it is
#   mapping (e.g. one row per cloud service) instead of by looking up each
#   story by key in the registry. The result is a story-detail table whose
#   rows map test cases to the WRONG stories — the requirements→tests audit
#   trail breaks silently, and no gate catches it.
#
#   This audit asserts two things for every `E<N>-S<M>` referenced in the
#   traceability matrix:
#
#     (a) Registry existence — the key is registered as a `### Story E<N>-S<M>:`
#         entry in epics-and-stories.md. A reference to a key that does not
#         exist in the registry is an INVENTED key (the strongest signal of
#         positional/sequential keying). Emitted as a hard issue.
#
#     (b) Scope compatibility — when a referenced row embeds a descriptive
#         title or scope phrase alongside the key (the story-detail row shape),
#         that phrase must share at least one significant token with the
#         registry title for that key. Zero token overlap is a likely
#         mis-keying (the row describes a different story than the registry
#         records under that key). Emitted as a hard issue.
#
#   This is the sibling of the epic / story-key registry integrity audit
#   (validate-epic-registry.sh): that script asserts keys are UNIQUE and
#   epics are not ORPHANED; this script asserts the traceability matrix
#   REFERENCES keys CONSISTENTLY with the registry's scope. The two are
#   complementary — neither subsumes the other.
#
#   The audit is READ-ONLY and emits a structured report on stdout. It exits 0
#   when no issues are found and non-zero when any issue is detected in
#   `--severity halt` mode, so it composes cleanly with `set -e` in callers.
#
# Invocation:
#   validate-traceability-consistency.sh [--epics-file <path>]
#                                        [--matrix-file <path>]
#                                        [--format text|json]
#                                        [--severity warn|halt]
#
# Inputs:
#   --epics-file   Path to the canonical epics-and-stories.md. Default:
#                  resolved from the standard artifact layout
#                  (.gaia/artifacts/planning-artifacts/epics-and-stories.md
#                  with fallback to docs/planning-artifacts/...).
#   --matrix-file  Path to the traceability matrix. Default: resolved across
#                  the flat / strategy / docs placements the framework
#                  supports for traceability-matrix.md.
#   --format       text (default — human-readable) | json (machine-readable).
#   --severity     warn (default — exit 0 even when issues found, advisory
#                  wiring) | halt (exit 1 when any issue found, hard gate).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no issues, OR issues found in `--severity warn` mode.
#   1 — issues found in `--severity halt` mode.
#   2 — usage error (missing/unknown flag, unreadable required input).

  validate-traceability-consistency.sh --help

Asserts every E<N>-S<M> referenced in the traceability matrix (a) exists as a
registered story in epics-and-stories.md and (b) where a story-detail table row
declares a scope cell, that scope shares at least one significant token with the
registry title for that key.

--check scope (default) gates only on [B] scope mismatches — the exact
signature of a mis-keyed story-detail row and the highest-signal check on a
mature matrix; [A] invented keys are shown as advisory (retired/orphan epics
inflate [A]). --check existence gates on [A] only; --check all gates on both.

Exit codes:
  0 — clean, OR issues found in `--severity warn` mode.
  1 — issues found in `--severity halt` mode.
  2 — usage error / unreadable input.

# ----- Scan the matrix in a SINGLE awk pass -------------------------------
# Two finding classes, by design separated so callers can gate on the
# high-signal one and treat the fuzzy one as advisory:
#
#   [A] invented key — any `E<N>-S<M>` referenced ANYWHERE in the matrix
#       (outside frontmatter / fenced code) that has no registry entry. This
#       is the strongest signal of positional/sequential keying and is the
#       finding a hard gate halts on.
#
#   [B] scope mismatch — restricted to genuine STORY-DETAIL TABLE ROWS: a
#       markdown table row `| E<N>-S<M> | <scope> | ... |` whose FIRST cell is
#       exactly one story key. The second cell is the row's declared scope; if
#       it shares zero significant tokens with the registry title for that key
#       the row is likely mis-keyed. This check is deliberately scoped to the
#       row shape the cascade sub-agent generates (per the defect report) so it
#       does not fire on roll-up rows, coverage-summary deltas, changelog
#       prose, or rows that merely mention a key in passing. [B] is ADVISORY
#       by default (see --check) because token-overlap on a mature
#       heterogeneous matrix is heuristic, not authoritative.
