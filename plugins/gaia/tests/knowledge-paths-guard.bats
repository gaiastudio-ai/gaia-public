# knowledge-paths-guard.bats — E28-S194 + E28-S196 regression guard for
# plugin-shipped reference data.
#
# Stories:
#   - E28-S194 — Retire `_gaia/_config/*.csv` literal paths from 15 SKILL.md
#     files and ship CSVs inside the plugin's knowledge/ tree.
#   - E28-S196 — Retire remaining `_gaia/_config/*` paths from 12 SKILL.md
#     files, ship 4 additional files (manifest.yaml, adversarial-triggers.yaml,
#     agent-manifest.csv, lifecycle-sequence.yaml) to plugin knowledge/, and
#     drop the `_gaia/_config/global.yaml` reference entirely in favor of
#     ADR-044 targets (project-config.yaml keys, resolve-config.sh output).
#
# After E28-S190 audit bucket B3, every non-project/non-machine-local v1 config
# file MUST live inside plugins/gaia/knowledge/ so the affected skills resolve
# them via ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/<file> instead of the legacy v1
# path _gaia/_config/<file> — which disappears after /gaia-migrate apply
# deletes _gaia/.

#
# Scope note: the story (E28-S194) targets the two CSVs that bucket B3 of the
# E28-S190 audit flagged — gaia-help.csv and workflow-manifest.csv. AC6's
# "grep returns 0 matches" reads broadly, but its intent (per the story title
# "Retire _gaia/_config/*.csv literal paths") and the AC4/AC5 specificity
# constrain the scope to CSV references. Non-CSV references (global.yaml,
# manifest.yaml, adversarial-triggers.yaml, lifecycle-sequence.yaml,
# agent-manifest.csv) remain out of scope for this story and are flagged in
# Findings for a follow-up cleanup pass.
