## Mission

You are the orchestrator for adding a new feature, enhancement, or patch to
the project. You classify the change scope and cascade updates through
exactly the set of affected artifacts. This skill delegates to sub-workflows
via subagents -- it does not perform direct edits to downstream artifacts.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy add-feature
workflow (E28-S57, FR-323) and is hardened by E48-S1 (FR-362) so that
validation gates are no longer swallowed inside subagents. The
classification vocabulary (patch / enhancement / feature), cascade matrix,
and delegation model are preserved verbatim from the legacy workflow.

## Critical Rules

- This is an orchestrator -- delegate to sub-workflows via subagents, do
  not perform edits directly.
- Context flows forward: PRD diff feeds architecture edit, which feeds test
  plan edit, which feeds story creation.
- Intelligently skip steps when not needed -- do not force all
  sub-workflows on every change.
- The classification vocabulary is EXACTLY: `patch`, `enhancement`,
  `feature`. Do NOT rename, alias, or refactor these terms -- downstream
  triage tooling and historical change requests depend on those exact
  strings.
- The cascade matrix (which artifacts are updated per classification) MUST
  match the definitions below exactly.
- Validation gates are MANDATORY surfacing points -- never silently consume
  Val verdicts inside a subagent. Always parse the ADR-037 return schema
  and apply the ADR-063 verdict-surfacing contract before continuing the
  cascade.
- A CRITICAL verdict from Val HALTS the skill before cascade execution.
  This applies in all execution modes (normal and YOLO) per ADR-067.

## Subagent Dispatch Contract

This skill follows the framework-wide Subagent Dispatch Contract (ADR-063).
Every Val invocation is dispatched via `context: fork` per ADR-045 with a
read-only tool allowlist `[Read, Grep, Glob, Bash]`, pinned to
`model: claude-opus-4-7` and `effort: high` per ADR-074 contract C2 (Val
opus pin — validation rigor is the contract). After Val returns:

1. **Parse the subagent return** using the ADR-037 structured schema:
   `{ status, summary, artifacts, findings, next }`. The `status` field is
   one of `PASS`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL`. Each entry in `findings` carries a
   `severity` of `CRITICAL`, `WARNING`, or `INFO`.
2. **Surface the verdict** to the user inline: display `status` and
   `summary`, then list every finding with its severity, scope, and
   recommended action.
3. **Halt on CRITICAL** -- if `status == "CRITICAL"` or any finding has
   `severity == "CRITICAL"`, the skill HALTS before cascade execution with
   an actionable error message. The user must resolve the finding before
   the skill can resume (or abort). No assessment-doc is emitted on a
   CRITICAL halt.
4. **Display WARNING** -- findings with `severity == "WARNING"` are
   displayed inline before proceeding. The skill does NOT halt; warnings
   are recorded in the assessment-doc Val Findings Summary section.
5. **Log INFO** -- findings with `severity == "INFO"` are written to the
   workflow checkpoint and the assessment-doc Val Findings Summary but are
   not surfaced inline unless the user requests verbose output.

This contract is enforced uniformly per ADR-063. CRITICAL findings cannot
be auto-dismissed in any execution mode.

## YOLO Behavior

This skill conforms to the framework-wide YOLO Mode Contract (ADR-067).

| Behavior | YOLO Action |
|----------|-------------|
| Template-output prompts (`[c]/[y]/[e]`) | Auto-continue (skip prompt). |
| Severity / filter selection | Auto-accept defaults. |
| Optional confirmation ("Proceed with cascade?") | Auto-confirm. |
| Subagent verdict display (Val review gate) | Auto-display, but a CRITICAL verdict still HALTS per ADR-063. |
| Open-question indicators (urgency, driver, CR linkage) | HALT -- never auto-skip; require human input. |
| Memory save prompt at end | HALT -- require human input (Phase 4 per ADR-061). |

In YOLO mode the Val verdict is auto-displayed but a CRITICAL verdict still
halts the skill -- this is the canonical YOLO/CRITICAL interaction
established by ADR-067.

## Classification Vocabulary

Changes are classified into exactly one of three categories:

| Classification | Scope | Description |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| **patch** | Minimal | A one-line typo fix, copy change, or trivial correction. Touches only the directly affected doc. Does NOT cascade to PRD, architecture, epics, test plan, threat model, or traceability. |
| **enhancement** | Moderate | A story-level change such as a new acceptance criterion on an existing story. Cascades to epics + test plan + traceability. Leaves PRD, architecture, and threat model untouched unless impact is explicitly flagged. |
| **feature** | Full | A net-new user-visible capability. Full cascade across PRD, architecture, epics, test plan, threat model, and traceability. |

## Cascade Matrix

The cascade matrix defines which artifacts are updated for each
classification:

| Artifact | patch | enhancement | feature |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| PRD (`docs/planning-artifacts/prd.md`) | -- | -- | YES |
| Architecture (`docs/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`) | -- | -- | YES |
| Epics & Stories (`docs/planning-artifacts/epics-and-stories.md`) | -- | YES | YES |
| Test Plan (`docs/test-artifacts/test-plan.md`) | -- | YES | YES |
| Threat Model (`docs/planning-artifacts/threat-model.md`) | -- | -- | YES |
| Traceability (`docs/test-artifacts/traceability-matrix.md`) | -- | YES | YES |

"--" means the artifact is NOT touched for that classification. "YES"
means the artifact IS updated via the appropriate sub-workflow.

## Steps

### Step 1 -- Capture Feature Scope

- Ask: Describe the new feature, enhancement, or fix you want to add.
- Ask: What is the **urgency**? Vocabulary: critical / high / medium / low.
  - critical -- blocking production or active customer impact.
  - high -- important and time-bound, fits next sprint.
  - medium -- normal backlog priority.
  - low -- nice-to-have, no time pressure.
- Ask: What is the **driver**? Vocabulary: user-request / bug-report /
  tech-debt / opportunity.
  - user-request -- explicit ask from a user, customer, or stakeholder.
  - bug-report -- defect, regression, or incorrect behaviour.
  - tech-debt -- internal quality, maintainability, or refactor.
  - opportunity -- new market, capability, or strategic improvement.
- Ask: Is this linked to a change request? If so, provide the CR ID.
- If CR exists: read `docs/planning-artifacts/change-request-{cr_id}.md`
  for context (impact analysis, approval status).
- Generate `feature_id` in the format `AF-{date}-{N}` where `{date}` is the
  current date (`AF-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{N}`, e.g. `AF-2026-04-26-1`) and `{N}`
  is a monotonically increasing integer for that date. To resolve `{N}`,
  scan `docs/planning-artifacts/epics-and-stories.md` and any prior
  `docs/planning-artifacts/assessment-AF-{date}-*.md` artifacts; use the
  highest existing index for today plus one, or `1` if none exist.
- Classify the change as **patch**, **enhancement**, or **feature** based
  on scope analysis.
- Present the scope summary to the user for confirmation before proceeding:
  - Feature ID: {feature_id}
  - Change: {description}
  - Classification: {patch / enhancement / feature}
  - Urgency: {critical / high / medium / low}
  - Driver: {user-request / bug-report / tech-debt / opportunity}
  - CR: {cr_id or "none"}
  - Expected cascade: {list of artifacts that will be updated per the
    cascade matrix}

### Step 2 -- Val Review Gate (mandatory verdict surfacing)

This step is the canonical Val review gate. It restores the validation
gate that previously ran silently inside the cascade subagents (the
regression class closed by ADR-063).

- Spawn a Val subagent via the Agent tool with `context: fork`,
  `model: claude-opus-4-7`, `effort: high`, and the read-only tool
  allowlist `[Read, Grep, Glob, Bash]` per ADR-045 and ADR-074 contract C2
  (Val opus pin). Pass the intake data captured in Step 1 (feature_id,
  description, classification, urgency, driver, CR linkage, expected
  cascade).
- **Non-opus mismatch guard (ADR-074 contract C2, AC3).** If a test
  fixture or downstream override forces a non-opus model into the dispatch
  context, this skill MUST emit the canonical WARNING `Val dispatch on
  non-opus model — forcing opus per ADR-074 contract C2` and force
  `model: claude-opus-4-7` before invoking Val. Silent degradation is
  forbidden.
- [Val opus-pin contract — see plugins/gaia/agents/validator.md §Val Operations]
- Val validates the intake against the codebase and ground truth and
  returns the ADR-037 structured schema:
  `{ status, summary, artifacts, findings, next }`.
- Apply the Subagent Dispatch Contract above:
  1. Display `status` and `summary` inline.
  2. List every finding with its severity, scope, and recommended action.
  3. **Halt on CRITICAL** -- if `status == "CRITICAL"` or any finding has
     `severity == "CRITICAL"`, HALT the skill before cascade execution
     with an actionable error message that includes the finding text and
     suggested resolution. Do NOT proceed to Step 3. Do NOT emit an
     assessment-doc -- the cascade did not run.
  4. Display WARNING findings inline; record them for the assessment-doc.
  5. Log INFO findings to the checkpoint and assessment-doc.
- In YOLO mode the verdict is auto-displayed (no `[c]/[y]/[e]` pause) but
  a CRITICAL verdict still HALTS per ADR-067.
- Only when no CRITICAL findings remain does the skill proceed to the
  cascade steps below.

### Step 3 -- Execute Cascade (patch)

- If classification is `patch`:
  - Apply the fix directly to the affected document.
  - No cascade -- no downstream artifacts are touched.
  - Skip to Step 9 (Emit Assessment-Doc) then Step 10 (Summary).

### Step 4 -- Edit PRD (feature only)

- If classification is `feature`:
  - Delegate to the edit-prd sub-workflow via subagent: add new functional
    and non-functional requirements.
  - Capture the PRD diff -- identify NEW requirement IDs (FR-*, NFR-*)
    added.
  - Capture the cascade classification from edit-prd (architecture
    impact: NONE / MINOR / SIGNIFICANT).
  - Store: `prd_diff`, `cascade_to_arch`.
- If classification is `enhancement` or `patch`: skip this step.

### Step 5 -- Edit Architecture (feature only, if needed)

- If classification is `feature` AND `cascade_to_arch != NONE`:
  - Delegate to the edit-architecture sub-workflow via subagent.
  - Capture the architecture diff -- new ADRs, changed sections.
  - Store: `arch_diff`.
- If `cascade_to_arch == NONE`: inform the user "No architecture changes
  needed" and skip.
- If classification is `enhancement` or `patch`: skip this step.

### Step 6 -- Edit Test Plan (enhancement and feature)

- If classification is `enhancement` or `feature`:
  - Check if `docs/test-artifacts/test-plan.md` exists. If not, recommend
    running `/gaia-test-design`.
  - If the test plan exists: delegate to the edit-test-plan sub-workflow
    via subagent.
  - **Orchestrator trigger inheritance (FR-353 / E46-S5).** When
    delegating to `/gaia-edit-test-plan`, pass the three inheritance
    contract fields as named invocation parameters:
    - `feature_description` -- the feature scope captured in Step 1
    - `prd_diff` -- the PRD diff captured in Step 4 (empty for
      `enhancement` classification, since Step 4 is skipped -- pass only
      when populated)
    - `arch_diff` -- the architecture diff captured in Step 5 (empty for
      `enhancement` classification, since Step 5 is skipped -- pass only
      when populated)
    Pass only the subset that is populated for the current classification.
    `/gaia-edit-test-plan` Step 2 handles the partial-inheritance case by
    prompting for missing fields. Do NOT pass empty strings for skipped
    fields -- omit them so the downstream three-case branch routes to
    PARTIAL rather than FULL with empty values.
  - Capture test plan additions (new test case IDs).
  - Store: `test_diff`.
- If classification is `patch`: skip this step.

### Step 7 -- Edit Threat Model (feature only)

- If classification is `feature`:
  - Check if `docs/planning-artifacts/threat-model.md` exists.
  - If it exists: update the threat model to account for new attack
    surfaces introduced by the feature.
  - Store: `threat_model_diff`.
- If classification is `enhancement` or `patch`: skip this step.

### Step 8 -- Add Feature Stories (enhancement and feature)

- If classification is `enhancement` or `feature`:
  - Delegate to the add-stories sub-workflow via subagent, passing
    `feature_description`, `prd_diff`, `arch_diff`, and `cr_id`.
  - Capture new story keys and epic assignments.
  - Store: `new_stories`.
  - Priority flag integration: if the urgency is `critical` or the driver
    is otherwise high-urgency (regulatory, business-critical), set
    `priority_flag: "next-sprint"` in each created story's frontmatter.
- If classification is `patch`: skip this step.

### Step 8b -- Update Traceability (enhancement and feature)

- If classification is `enhancement` or `feature`:
  - Delegate to the traceability sub-workflow via subagent to regenerate
    the traceability matrix.
  - Verify new FR / NFR IDs, test cases, and stories are linked.
- If classification is `patch`: skip this step.

### Step 9 -- Emit Assessment-Doc Artifact

This step runs only after the cascade completes successfully and Val
returned no CRITICAL findings in Step 2. If Step 2 halted on CRITICAL,
no assessment-doc is emitted -- the user must resolve the CRITICAL
finding first and re-invoke the skill.

- Write the assessment-doc to
  `docs/planning-artifacts/assessment-{feature_id}.md` with the following
  sections:

  - **Header** -- feature_id, date, author, classification, urgency,
    driver, CR linkage.
  - **Classification** -- the chosen classification (patch / enhancement /
    feature) with a one-line scope rationale.
  - **Affected Artifacts** -- the list of artifacts touched per the
    cascade matrix for the chosen classification, with the actual diff
    summaries captured during the cascade. Skipped artifacts are listed
    with "(skipped: classification = {patch|enhancement})" so the audit
    trail is explicit.
  - **Cascade Plan** -- a numbered list of the sub-workflows dispatched in
    order, with the resulting diff IDs (new FR / NFR IDs, ADR numbers,
    test case IDs, story keys) captured at each step. For patch
    classification this section reads "(no cascade -- direct edit
    applied)".
  - **Val Findings Summary** -- the verdict from Step 2 (PASS / WARNING)
    plus the full list of WARNING and INFO findings with their severity,
    scope, and recommended action. CRITICAL findings never appear here
    because they would have halted the skill before this step.

- The assessment-doc serves as the audit trail: who proposed what change,
  what Val said about it, what artifacts ended up touched, and which
  follow-up stories were created. It is written ONLY after the cascade
  completes successfully.

### Step 10 -- Summary

- Present the final summary:

  **Change Addition Complete: {description}**

  | Artifact | Status | Details |
  |----------|--------|---------|
  | Feature ID | {feature_id} | {AF-YYYY-MM-DD-N} |
  | Classification | {patch / enhancement / feature} | {scope rationale} |
  | Urgency | {critical / high / medium / low} | -- |
  | Driver | {user-request / bug-report / tech-debt / opportunity} | -- |
  | Val Verdict | {PASS / WARNING} | {N WARNING findings} |
  | PRD | {Updated / Skipped} | {new FR/NFR IDs or "N/A"} |
  | Architecture | {Updated / Skipped} | {new ADRs or "N/A"} |
  | Test Plan | {Updated / Skipped / Not found} | {new test case IDs or reason} |
  | Threat Model | {Updated / Skipped} | {changes or "N/A"} |
  | Stories | {Created / Skipped} | {new story keys or "N/A"} |
  | Traceability | {Regenerated / Skipped} | {linkage status} |
  | Assessment Doc | {emitted / skipped} | docs/planning-artifacts/assessment-{feature_id}.md |

  **Next steps:**
  - For each new story: run `/gaia-create-story {story_key}` to elaborate.
  - To start development: run `/gaia-sprint-plan` or `/gaia-correct-course`.
  - To audit this change later: read
    `docs/planning-artifacts/assessment-{feature_id}.md`.
