description: Disable the Test Execution Bridge by delegating to gaia-bridge-toggle with mode=disable. Thin wrapper that preserves the user-visible /gaia-bridge-disable slash command (AC11, FR-323). Edits test_execution_bridge.bridge_enabled = false in config/project-config.yaml (per ADR-044). Flag takes effect immediately under the native plugin. Idempotent — no write when already disabled. Skips post-flip checks (AC7).

## Mission

You are the `/gaia-bridge-disable` wrapper. This skill preserves the existing user-visible slash command while delegating the full toggle semantics to `gaia-bridge-toggle`.

This skill is part of the native Claude Code conversion under E28-S111 (Cluster 14). The legacy `bridge-toggle` workflow is converted to `gaia-bridge-toggle/SKILL.md`; this wrapper keeps the disable-specific alias working per ADR-041 and AC11 of E28-S111.

## Critical Rules

- **Delegate to `gaia-bridge-toggle` with mode=disable.** Do NOT duplicate the toggle logic here.
- **Hard-code mode=disable.** This wrapper is disable-only. Ignore any `$ARGUMENTS` that attempt to override the mode.
- **Preserve the user-visible slash command.** `/gaia-bridge-disable` must continue to resolve for OSS users with zero behavioral change (AC11).
- **Skip post-flip checks on disable (AC7).** The disable path does not run the test-environment.yaml stat — the summary only confirms the new state.

## Delegation

Follow the full `gaia-bridge-toggle` skill body with `mode = disable`:

1. Resolve the current `test_execution_bridge.bridge_enabled` value via `scripts/resolve-config.sh` (per ADR-044 — the flag lives at `test_execution_bridge.bridge_enabled` in `config/project-config.yaml`; the legacy v1 location `_gaia/_config/global.yaml` is retired and no longer used).
2. If the section is missing, fail fast with `test_execution_bridge block missing — run /gaia-ci-setup first`.
3. If already `false`, report `Bridge already disabled` and exit without writing.
4. Otherwise, perform the regex-based in-place edit to `config/project-config.yaml` to flip `bridge_enabled: true` → `bridge_enabled: false`, preserving all comments and formatting.
5. Skip Post-Flip Checks (AC7 — disable mode does not run them).
6. Emit the summary. Under the native plugin (ADR-044/ADR-048) the flag change takes effect immediately — no config rebuild is required.

The full step-by-step procedure is documented in `plugins/gaia/skills/gaia-bridge-toggle/SKILL.md`. This wrapper inherits all behavior from that skill, with Step 4 explicitly skipped per AC7.
