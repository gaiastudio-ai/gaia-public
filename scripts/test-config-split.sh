# test-config-split.sh — Cluster 20 test gate (E28-S145)
#
# Drives plugins/gaia/scripts/resolve-config.sh across the four project-
# structure fixtures defined in tests/fixtures/config-split/ and against
# the live repository (Fixture C), compares resolved values against an
# expected oracle per fixture, and writes an authoritative test report
# to docs/migration/config-split-test-report.md.
#
# Fixtures:
#   A — root-project         (project_path: ".")
#   B — subdir-project       (project_path: "my-app")
#   C — live repo            (project_path: "gaia-public", current GAIA setup)
#   D — no-shared-config     (global.yaml only, no project-config.yaml)
#   overlap — overlap-precedence (local overrides shared per ADR-044 §10.26.3)
#
# Exit code 0 on full pass. Non-zero on any fixture failure so CI can gate.
# Idempotent — two back-to-back runs produce identical reports (date and SHA
# are captured deterministically from the same resolver run, no wall-clock
# drift in the recorded oracle comparisons).
