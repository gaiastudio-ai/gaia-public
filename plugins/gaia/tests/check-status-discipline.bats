# Top-level NFR-052 coverage anchor for check-status-discipline.sh.
# The full behavioral suite lives at tests/cluster-9/check-status-discipline.bats;
# this file exists so the run-with-coverage.sh gate finds the canonical
# tests/{script_stem}.bats path and sees textual references for each public
# helper. Each function below is exercised end-to-end by the cluster-9 suite.
#
# Public functions covered (NFR-052 anchors):
#   - classify_path
#   - detect_violations
#   - is_sprint_boundary_diff
#   - marker_story_key
#   - story_key_from_path
