# finalize.sh — Cluster 11 gaia-ci-edit skill finalize (E28-S86, fixed E28-S199)
#
# Originally a mechanical copy of the Cluster 9 reference finalize.sh
# (E28-S66 gaia-code-review). E28-S197 triage (F3 / ContractBug) identified
# the unconditional `validate-gate.sh ci_setup_exists` invocation as
# inappropriate for ci-edit: the skill only edits an existing setup file,
# so on a fresh fixture (no prior setup) the gate fails tautologically and
# masks the real error. E28-S199 replaces the unconditional call with a
# conditional guard driven by a runtime marker written by setup.sh.
#
# Conditional-guard contract:
#   setup.sh probes for docs/test-artifacts/ci-setup.md at invocation time.
#   If present, it writes ${PROJECT_ROOT:-$PWD}/.gaia/run-state/ci-edit-had-prior-setup
#   as a marker. finalize.sh inspects the same marker:
#     - marker absent  → no prior setup existed when the edit started;
#                       skip the ci_setup_exists post-check entirely
#                       (fresh-fixture runs exit 0 cleanly — AC5).
#     - marker present → a prior setup was observed by setup.sh;
#                       the gate runs as a regression guard and will exit
#                       non-zero if the edit body erased the file (AC6).
#   finalize.sh removes the marker on every exit path so the next edit
#   run re-probes fresh — the marker is per-run, not sticky.
#
# Responsibilities:
#   1. Conditional post-edit gate verification (marker-gated — E28-S199)
#   2. Write a checkpoint via the shared checkpoint.sh foundation script
#   3. Emit a lifecycle event via lifecycle-event.sh for the tailing sync agent
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — finalize succeeded
#   1 — gate validation (when marker present), checkpoint write, or
#       lifecycle event emission failed
