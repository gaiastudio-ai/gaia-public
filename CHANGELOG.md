# Changelog

All notable changes to the `gaia-public` marketplace and the `gaia` plugin are recorded here.
This file tracks sprint-level resolutions and decisions — for commit-level history, see `git log`.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) loosely, and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for the `gaia` plugin
(tracked in `plugins/gaia/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).

## [Unreleased]

### v1.132.x — Dev-story tooling quirks cleanup (E64-S1)

- **E64-S1**: bundle four sprint-33 dev-story tooling quirks into a single
  cleanup pass.
  - `dod-check.sh` no longer falls through to the system POSIX
    `/bin/test` builtin for the `tests` row. The script now resolves a
    project test command via deterministic precedence:
    `config/project-config.yaml test_cmd:` → `package.json scripts.test`
    (via `npm test`) → `bats tests/*.bats` discovery. When no signal
    resolves, the row is reported as `SKIPPED — no test runner detected`
    (exit 0), never `FAILED`.
  - `dod-check.sh` subtask scan is scoped to the `## Tasks / Subtasks`
    section. Unchecked items in `## Definition of Done` (e.g., "PR merged
    to staging" pre-merge) and `## Acceptance Criteria` are intentionally
    excluded from the count. Stories whose Tasks/Subtasks are all checked
    now PASS the subtask row even when the DoD section legitimately
    carries unchecked items at Step 9.
  - New shared parser library
    `skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/frontmatter-lib.sh` with `fm_slice`
    (extract YAML frontmatter block) and `fm_get_field` (read a single
    field). `story-parse.sh`, `pr-body.sh`, and `commit-msg.sh` now
    source the library instead of carrying three duplicated awk
    implementations of the same primitive.
  - `commit-msg.sh` emits commitlint-safe subjects by prepending a
    lowercase verb derived from the story `type:` field (`feature` →
    `wire`, `bug` → `fix`, `refactor` → `refactor`, `chore` → `update`).
    Story titles that already start with a lowercase verb are passed
    through unchanged. Effect: PRs opened from a `/gaia-dev-story` run
    on a story whose title begins with an ALL-CAPS or PascalCase token
    (e.g., `SKILL.md gate wiring`, `API client retry policy`) now pass
    the `lint-pr-title` GitHub Action check without manual `gh pr edit`
    intervention.

### v1.131.x — TDD Review Gate Default

- **Deprecation — `/gaia-dev-story` Steps 1, 10, 11 narrative fallback**: the
  inline LLM narrative paths for frontmatter parsing (Step 1), commit-message
  composition / promotion-chain inference (Step 10), and PR-body construction
  (Step 11) are deprecated in v1.131.x and removed in v1.132.0. The canonical
  paths now run through `story-parse.sh`, `detect-mode.sh`, `check-deps.sh`,
  `promotion-chain-guard.sh`, `commit-msg.sh`, and `pr-body.sh`. Brownfield
  projects on a stale plugin retain a single-minor-version fallback gated on
  `command -v <script>`; upgrade to v1.132.0 will hard-remove the fallback.
- **E57-S8**: wire the six new helper scripts (`story-parse.sh`,
  `detect-mode.sh`, `check-deps.sh`, `promotion-chain-guard.sh`, `commit-msg.sh`,
  `pr-body.sh`) into `/gaia-dev-story` SKILL.md at Steps 1, 10, and 11.
  Narrative fallback retained for one minor version (v1.131.x → v1.132.0) so
  brownfield projects don't break mid-upgrade. Regression bats at
  `tests/dev-story-script-wiring.bats` enforces the wiring contract.
- **E57-S1**: introduce the `dev_story.tdd_review` config block consumed by
  `/gaia-dev-story`. The block ships in `project-config.schema.yaml` and
  `project-config.yaml.example` with the following defaults:
  - `threshold: medium` — risk threshold at which the post-Red TDD review
    gate prompt fires. Allowed values: `off | low | medium | high`.
  - `phases: [red]` — TDD phases at which the review fires.
  - `qa_auto_in_yolo: true` — YOLO mode auto-runs the QA review after
    the gate.
  - `qa_timeout_seconds: 600` — per-review timeout for the QA auto-run.
  - **User-visible effect:** stories with `risk: medium` or higher will
    see a one-time prompt after the TDD Red phase asking whether to run
    the review immediately. Existing low-risk and unset-risk stories see
    no behavior change.
  - **Opt-out:** set `threshold: off` in your shared `project-config.yaml`
    to disable the gate entirely.
  - The four resolved values round-trip via
    `resolve-config.sh --field dev_story.tdd_review.<key>`.

### Sprint 24 (E28 — GAIA Native Conversion Program)

#### Reverted

- **E28-S187 — reverts E28-S185**: restore `allowed-tools:` as the canonical
  SKILL.md frontmatter field across all 115 plugin skills and 3 enterprise
  mirror skills. E28-S185 renamed `allowed-tools:` → `tools:` based on a
  misreading of the Claude Code skills documentation at
  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills. On 2026-04-19 the official docs
  were re-read and confirmed that `allowed-tools:` IS the canonical field
  name (both the YAML list form `allowed-tools: [A, B]` and the
  space/comma-separated string form `allowed-tools: A, B` are accepted).
  The "0 skills" symptom that motivated E28-S185 is unrelated — it is a
  known limitation of `/reload-plugins` not counting plugin-shipped skills;
  Anthropic's own `claude-code-setup` plugin reproduces the same counter
  behavior while shipping `tools:` in its SKILL.md.
  - Net effect: documented canonical field name restored; no behavioral
    change because both forms are accepted by the Claude Code skill loader.
  - `plugins/gaia/skills/*/SKILL.md` (115 files): `tools: A, B, C` →
    `allowed-tools: [A, B, C]` (YAML list form).
  - `gaia-enterprise/plugins/gaia-enterprise/skills/*/SKILL.md` (3 files):
    re-reverted in lockstep in the enterprise repo.
  - `plugins/gaia/scripts/fix-skill-tools-field.sh` removed; replaced by
    `plugins/gaia/scripts/revert-skill-tools-field.sh` — idempotent
    companion script that converts `tools: A, B, C` back to
    `allowed-tools: [A, B, C]`.
  - `plugins/gaia/tests/skill-frontmatter-guard.bats` flipped: now enforces
    that every plugin SKILL.md uses `allowed-tools:` (not `tools:`) and
    that values use YAML list form.
  - `.github/scripts/lint-skill-frontmatter.sh` flipped: rejects the
    retired `tools:` top-level key, validates the `allowed-tools:` key
    (canonical field).
  - Parity bats suites (44 files), shell smoke scripts (10 files), and
    `_reference-frontmatter.md` docs (10 files) reverted to reference the
    restored `allowed-tools:` field.
  - `plugins/gaia/tests/e28-s187-revert-tools-field.bats`: new regression
    test covering AC1–AC6 and round-trip behavior of the revert script.

#### Added

- **E28-S171** `docs/INDEX.md` — single discovery entry point for GAIA
  artifact directories. Addresses E28-S132 triage finding F1 (missing-setup,
  low severity).
  - `gaia-public/docs/INDEX.md` — new top-level index describing the three
    GAIA artifact directories (`planning-artifacts/`,
    `implementation-artifacts/`, `test-artifacts/`) with role descriptions
    and typical contents for each. Clarifies that these directories live
    under each GAIA project's own `docs/` tree (not vendored into the
    marketplace repo).
  - `gaia-public/README.md` — added a Documentation section linking to
    `docs/INDEX.md` (AC3 cross-link).
  - `gaia-public/tests/atdd/e28-s171-docs-index-entry-point.bats` — ATDD
    coverage: ten assertions covering file existence, per-directory link
    presence, per-directory role-description prose, README link-back,
    top-level heading, non-trivial length.
- **E28-S170** manual integration-test plan for `/gaia-migrate` edge cases
  AC-EC2 / AC-EC3 / AC-EC5 / AC-EC7 — the four edge cases from E28-S131 that
  are not bats-testable without significant environmental scaffolding
  (tmpfs size caps, corrupt-byte fixtures, sidecar schema drift fixtures,
  signal-interrupt timing).
  - Test plan document: `docs/test-artifacts/E28-S170-gaia-migrate-edge-cases-test-plan.md`
    (project-root artifact; not in this repo). Nine sections: executive
    summary, prerequisites (fixture + tooling), four scenarios (one per
    edge case) with environment setup / reproduction steps / expected
    behavior / pass-fail criteria / teardown, reporting, traceability.
  - `gaia-public/plugins/gaia/skills/gaia-migrate/SKILL.md` — added a
    cross-reference to the test plan under the References section so the
    skill points users at the plan for advanced (manual) edge-case
    verification.
  - Observed-baseline recording (AC-EC5 and AC-EC7): the current
    `gaia-migrate.sh` implementation does not detect sidecar schema drift
    (EC5) and does not install a SIGINT trap handler (EC7). Both gaps are
    logged in the story's Findings table as tech-debt / low-severity
    follow-ups for future stories. Backup-before-migration ordering
    preserves v1 state through the interrupt window.

### Sprint 23 (E28 — GAIA Native Conversion Program, Cluster 18 close)

#### Added

- **E28-S131** `/gaia-migrate` skill — automate v1 → v2 upgrade. Final story
  of Cluster 18.
  - `gaia-public/plugins/gaia/skills/gaia-migrate/SKILL.md` — user-facing
    flow (frontmatter `name: gaia-migrate` + description + `when_to_use`),
    confirms intent, runs dry-run first, surfaces SUCCESS/FAILED banner,
    cross-references the migration guide as the authoritative manual-steps
    source.
  - `gaia-public/plugins/gaia/scripts/gaia-migrate.sh` — backing script
    (per ADR-042 scripts-over-LLM). Modes: `apply`, `dry-run`. Central
    `_safe_write()` helper gates every cp/mv/rm/mkdir behind the dry-run
    flag — single safety mechanism for AC5 dry-run idempotency and
    AC-EC6 dry-run-accidental-write protection. Pipeline: detect → backup
    → 3 migration subtasks (templates, sidecars, config-split per FR-326)
    → validate → SUCCESS/FAILED summary with restore command.
  - Backup is always created BEFORE any migration write (AC2).
    Timestamped at `{project-root}/.gaia-migrate-backup/{YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS}/`
    with `backup-manifest.yaml` containing sha256 per file.
  - Config split (subtask 4.3) implements FR-326 partition: 17 local keys
    stay in `_gaia/_config/global.yaml`, 6 shared keys move to
    `{project-root}/config/project-config.yaml`.
  - Sidecar migration (subtask 4.2) is verify-only — v1 and v2 layouts
    match under current ADR set.
  - Validation (AC4) checks plugin discoverability, YAML parse, and
    structural keys. `/gaia-help` smoke-test deferred to manual follow-up
    (can't invoke from script context).
  - 24 bats tests at `plugins/gaia/test/scripts/e28-s131-gaia-migrate.bats`
    cover SKILL.md frontmatter (4), backup-before-write (4), 3 migration
    steps + partition (5), validation banners (2), dry-run + idempotency
    (3), edge cases AC-EC1 / AC-EC6 / re-run safety / no-v1-detected (4),
    arg parsing (2). v1 fixture tree at
    `plugins/gaia/test/scripts/fixtures/v1-install/` (9 files).
  - `dead-reference-scan.sh` allowlist extended for the new skill, script,
    bats file, and fixture tree (all intentionally reference v1 retired
    paths for detection / migration purposes).
  - `gaia-public/docs/migration-guide-v2.md` extended with §10
    "Automated migration via /gaia-migrate" cross-referencing the skill
    and listing equivalence between manual sections and automated steps.

  This story closes Cluster 18 (Cleanup & Migration) — the final 5
  retirement / migration stories (S126-S131) are now all merged.

- **E28-S130** v1 → v2 migration guide. Expanded the E28-S126 stub at
  `gaia-public/docs/migration-guide-v2.md` to a full 9-section guide
  covering: Prerequisites (with `/plugin marketplace list` gate),
  Backup (with checksums), Install (with two-track procedure for
  `project_path: "."` vs subdirectory), Migrate Templates (byte-identical
  preservation via `diff -r`), Migrate Memory (sidecar checksum verification),
  Update CLAUDE.md (replaces ~227-line v1 with the slim 30-line v2 from
  E28-S129), Verify (preserves the E28-S126 "Legacy engine cleanup"
  subsection verbatim per its coordination note), Rollback (STOP-first
  with idempotent restore commands), Reviewer Orientation appendix
  (5-minute conceptual overview + ADR/PRD links for non-E28 reviewers).
  Global step IDs (S1.1, S2.3, etc.) for support-conversation reference.
  Pointer at `docs/migration/migration-guide-v2.md` (project-root convention).
  Backed by 19 bats tests covering section presence, two-track procedure,
  reviewer-orientation references, and the preserved E28-S126 cleanup
  subsection.

- **E28-S129** NFR-049 / FR-327 CLAUDE.md slim rewrite. Shipped the slim
  `gaia-public/CLAUDE.md` (30 lines) containing only environment configuration,
  how-to-start pointers, and hard rules. The project-root `CLAUDE.md` (the
  normative NFR-049 target, not git-tracked by any of this repo's scope)
  is synced byte-identical from the `gaia-public/` copy.
  - Dropped content (moved to SKILL.md per FR-327 / ADR-048): workflow-engine
    narrative, step-execution rules, config-resolution chain, checkpoint
    discipline, context budget, quality-gate procedures, sprint-status
    write-safety, sprint state machine table, review-gate vocabulary,
    naming conventions, developer-agent-system narrative, memory-hygiene
    narrative, npm-publishing procedure, version-bumping procedure.
  - Kept content: title/version heading (`# GAIA Framework v1.127.2-rc.1`),
    environment section, hard rules (7 bullets covering secrets, feature
    branches, no-AI-attribution, version-bump discipline, dev-story PR gate,
    directory identity, FR-329 commands retirement, sprint-status write safety).
  - New bats test at `plugins/gaia/test/scripts/e28-s129-claude-md-slim.bats`
    (13 tests) asserts line count ∈ [30, 50], version-heading regex, section
    presence (Environment / How to Start / Hard Rules), and content-exclusion
    grep for every removed section header.
  - `dead-reference-scan.sh` allowlist extended for the new bats file.

- **E28-S128** FR-328 workflow-artifact retirement — verify + scanner coverage.
  Third iteration of the "verify + guard + scrub" pattern (after E28-S126 / E28-S127).
  The product-source `gaia-public/plugins/gaia/` tree was already clean at
  story-start (0 `workflow.yaml` / `instructions.xml` / `checklist.md` files).
  Runtime `_gaia/*/workflows/` (423 files) is out of scope and cleaned up by
  `gaia-cleanup-legacy-engine.sh` shipped in E28-S126.

  The active work concentrated on Task 5 (reference cleanup):

  - `plugins/gaia/scripts/dead-reference-scan.sh` — PATTERN extended with
    3 new tightened-word-boundary regexes (`(^|[^-a-z])workflow\.yaml\b`,
    `(^|[^-a-z])instructions\.xml\b`, `(^|[^-a-z])checklist\.md\b`). The
    leading character class prevents false-positives inside compound filenames
    like `deployment-checklist.md` and `my-workflow.yaml`.
  - A new `is_shell_variable_context()` helper in the same scanner filters
    shell-variable forms (`$workflow.yaml`, `${name}.yaml`,
    `$workflow.yaml.lock`) so bash scripts like `checkpoint.sh` that use
    variable interpolation producing runtime filenames are not falsely flagged.
  - `is_allowlisted()` extended with an enumerated 41-entry block covering
    every SKILL.md and skill-companion script that cites the retired filenames
    as **parity references per NFR-053**. These citations are historical
    documentation, not active loads — see the triage ledger at
    `docs/implementation-artifacts/E28-S128-triage-ledger.md` for the full
    per-file rationale.
  - `plugins/gaia/test/scripts/e28-s126-dead-reference-scan.bats` — 9 new
    tests covering the extended PATTERN + negative-filter: 5 positive
    (backtick-prose, path-form, parenthesized, colon-prefixed, bare-word),
    3 negative (shell-variable forms correctly filtered), 1 allowlist
    (docs/ reference).

  No new CI workflow; `adr-048-guard.yml` already runs `dead-reference-scan.sh`
  unconditionally, so the PATTERN extension is picked up automatically on
  every future PR.

- **E28-S127** FR-329 slash-command retirement — verify + regression guard.
  The converted plugin's `plugins/gaia/commands/` directory was already empty
  at story-start (skill-based invocation via `plugins/gaia/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`
  is the sole user-facing surface). This PR ships the FR-329 regression
  prevention:
  - `plugins/gaia/scripts/commands-guard.sh` — narrow-scope directory guard;
    exits 1 if any `gaia-*.md` file reappears under `plugins/gaia/commands/`,
    exits 0 when the directory is absent or empty. Shellcheck-clean.
  - `.github/workflows/adr-048-guard.yml` — extended with an **unconditional**
    commands-guard step (FR-329 is permanent, not closing-only) that runs on
    every PR to staging or main.
  - `plugins/gaia/scripts/dead-reference-scan.sh` — PATTERN extended with two
    file-path regexes (`.claude/commands/gaia-*.md` and
    `plugins/gaia/commands/gaia-*.md`) so the canonical active-code scanner
    also catches stale file-path references. The invocation form `/gaia-foo`
    used in skill prose is deliberately excluded by anchoring on the `.md`
    extension — slash-command mentions in documentation and skill bodies
    continue to resolve correctly.
  - `plugins/gaia/test/scripts/e28-s127-commands-guard.bats` — 9 tests covering
    absent directory, empty directory, non-gaia file, single regression,
    mixed tree, multiple regressions, missing arg, non-existent project-root.
  - `plugins/gaia/test/scripts/e28-s126-dead-reference-scan.bats` — 4 new
    tests for the extended PATTERN (file-path detection, invocation-form
    negative, docs allowlist).

  The story's original deletion work was vacuously satisfied (AC1 — the
  target directory does not exist; delta documented per AC2's
  "matches the documented current actual count" clause and Test Scenario #2).
  AC4 (skill invocation still works) is covered by the Cluster 19 parity
  harness (E28-S133/S139 PASSED) which proved end-to-end skill resolution.

- **E28-S126** Program-closing tooling for the ADR-048 engine deletion. Ships
  three new foundation scripts under `plugins/gaia/scripts/`:
  - `verify-cluster-gates.sh` — pre-start verifier that reads all 12 cluster-gate
    story files (E28-S76, S81, S95, S99, S118, S133–S139) and confirms each is
    `status: done` with all 6 Review Gate rows `PASSED`. Exit 0 when the gate is
    open, 1 on any block, 2 on parse error. Used by both the migration CLI and
    the new CI guard.
  - `dead-reference-scan.sh` — grep-based active-code scanner that fails the
    build when any `plugins/gaia/**` skill, script, agent, or CI workflow
    references retired legacy-engine paths (workflow.xml, core/protocols/,
    .resolved/, workflow-manifest.csv, task-manifest.csv, skill-manifest.csv,
    lifecycle-sequence.yaml). Allowlist preserves documentation, CHANGELOG,
    migration guide, parity-guard bats, negated mandates, and the E28-S126
    tooling itself.
  - `gaia-cleanup-legacy-engine.sh` — idempotent migration CLI that removes
    the retired engine, protocols, four `_config/` manifests, five module
    configs, and every nested `.resolved/` from the local `_gaia/` runtime.
    Pre-flight guards cover clean-working-tree (AC-EC8), in-flight legacy
    checkpoints (AC-EC2), and cluster-gate status (AC-EC4). Flags `--dry-run`,
    `--force-dirty`, `--project-root`. **NOT invoked by this PR — shipped for
    end-user cutover after installing the native plugin.**
- **E28-S126** New CI guard at `.github/workflows/adr-048-guard.yml`. Rejects
  PRs to `staging` or `main` that introduce active-code references to retired
  engine paths unless the `program-closing` label is set AND all 12 cluster
  gates are `done`+`PASSED`. Flag alone is insufficient — the guard re-verifies
  the cluster-gate checklist before allowing the merge (AC-EC6).
- **E28-S126** bats-core test suite (5 files, 38 tests, 50 fixture files)
  covering every AC and edge case: happy path, idempotency, dirty tree,
  locked path, in-flight checkpoint, nested `.resolved/` at depth 5, dead-ref
  scan active vs allowlisted, `next-step.sh` fallback, `gaia-help` fallback
  contract.
- **E28-S126** Migration guide stub at `docs/migration-guide-v2.md` with only
  the "Legacy engine cleanup (manual cutover)" section populated under
  §Verify. E28-S130 fills the remaining sections around this anchor.

#### Changed

- **E28-S126** `plugins/gaia/scripts/next-step.sh` — added graceful-missing-file
  fallback: when `lifecycle-sequence.yaml` or `workflow-manifest.csv` are
  absent (expected state post-cutover), prints "legacy manifests not available
  under native plugin — nothing to suggest" and exits 0 instead of the legacy
  exit-2 hard-fail. Strict-mode preserved via `GAIA_NEXT_STEP_STRICT=1` for
  backward compatibility.
- **E28-S126** `plugins/gaia/skills/gaia-validate-framework/SKILL.md` — rewrote
  Step 5 (Manifest Integrity) and Step 6 (Config Resolution) to only verify
  survivors (`agent-manifest.csv`, `global.yaml`). The three retired manifests
  and the `.resolved/` pre-compile chain are explicitly noted as removed under
  ADR-044/ADR-048.
- **E28-S126** `plugins/gaia/skills/gaia-code-review-standards/SKILL.md` —
  rewrote §Enforcement Mechanism (Live) at line 250 to reference the native
  replacement `plugins/gaia/scripts/review-gate.sh` instead of the retired
  `_gaia/core/protocols/review-gate-check.xml`.
- **E28-S126** `plugins/gaia/skills/gaia-bridge-{toggle,enable,disable}/SKILL.md`
  — removed all references to the retired `/gaia-build-configs` command and
  the `.resolved/` pre-compile step. Updated descriptions (visible in Claude's
  skill-discovery UI) and bodies to reflect that the flag flip takes effect
  immediately under the native plugin.

#### Removed

- Nothing was deleted from the repository by this PR. The deletion script
  targets are the local `_gaia/` runtime instance, which is not git-tracked.
  Actual deletion happens at end-user cutover after installing the native
  plugin — see the "Legacy engine cleanup" section in
  `docs/migration-guide-v2.md`.

### Sprint 19 (E28 — GAIA Native Conversion Program)

#### Added

- **E28-S140** Cluster 19 bug-fix buffer (zero-work close). Added
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19/bug-fix-triage.md`,
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19/bug-fix-revalidation.md`, and
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19/bug-fix-rollup.md` documenting the buffer
  outcome: the triage pass scanned every defect surface from E28-S133..S139
  (Findings tables, `failure.log` files, FAIL rows in §11.37.1–§11.37.3
  verdict tables, and the regression-defect channel declared by E28-S139
  AC-EC6) and logged **0 bug-type defects**. The two non-bug findings
  surfaced by E28-S136 (documentation drift in `architecture.md §10.26.3`
  and a forward-looking `/gaia-resume` skill gap) are explicitly deferred
  to backlog per AC2 with rationale. The full NCP-01..NCP-20 harness
  (§11.37.1 + §11.37.2 + §11.37.3) reads 20/20 PASS across every owned row.
  `v-parity-baseline` tag is unchanged (AC-EC7 asserted). **Cluster 19
  bug-fix buffer: 0 defects processed, 0 fixed, 2 non-bug findings deferred;
  Cluster 19 verdict: PASS.** E28-S126 (Cluster 18 cleanup / Cluster 19
  sign-off entry gate) is unblocked.

- **E28-S139** Cluster 19 token-reduction coverage (NFR-048). Added the
  measurement driver at `plugins/gaia/test/scripts/token-reduction/` with
  a pinned surrogate tokenizer (`tokenize.mjs`, `tokenizer.version`
  `sha256:3c0c1f82…`), the 5 immutable fixture driver inputs under
  `plugins/gaia/test/fixtures/parity-baseline/token-budget/{dev-story,
  create-prd,code-review,sprint-planning,brownfield-onboarding}/driver-input.txt`,
  and the 13-case structural contract at
  `tests/cluster-19-e2e/token-reduction.bats` + the vitest-equivalent at
  `test/validation/atdd/e28-s139.test.js`. Raw captures (baseline prompt,
  native prompt, baseline count, native count, NCP-20 determinism re-run
  count) are published under
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19/token-budget/{workflow}/` for all 5
  workflows. Methodology pinned in
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19/token-reduction-methodology.md` (tokenizer,
  scope, determinism, baseline-vs-native harness, workflow selection) and
  results consolidated in
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19/token-reduction-results.md`. First run:
  dev-story 50.0%, create-prd 40.0%, code-review 44.0%, sprint-planning 45.0%,
  brownfield-onboarding 50.0% — every per-workflow row PASS on the 40% hard
  gate; aggregate 45.8% is below the 55% stretch and recorded as a
  non-blocking NCP-19 warning; NCP-20 determinism re-run is byte-identical
  across all 5 workflows. **Cluster 19 token-reduction coverage recorded;
  NFR-048 verdict: PASS.** `cluster-19-e2e-test-plan.md` matrix row 7 now
  points at the results artifact; `test-plan.md §11.37.3` NCP-14..NCP-20
  marked PASS with evidence links back to the results table.

- **E28-S137** Cluster 19 quality-gate-enforcement parity test. Added
  `tests/cluster-19-e2e/quality-gate-enforcement.bats` (12 bats cases covering
  all 5 enforced testing-integration gates: `create-epics-stories.test-plan`,
  `implementation-readiness.traceability-matrix` + `.ci-setup` across 3
  variants, `dev-story.atdd` for high-risk stories plus a low-risk negative
  control that proves the gate is scoped correctly, `deployment-checklist`
  across 4 variants, and `brownfield-onboarding.nfr-assessment` +
  `.performance-test-plan` post-complete). Added 11 synthesized fixture
  files under
  `plugins/gaia/test/fixtures/cluster-19/quality-gate-enforcement/`
  (6 sub-variant trees, all registered with sha256 in
  `fixture-manifest.yaml`) and the parity oracle at
  `plugins/gaia/test/fixtures/parity-baseline/traces/quality-gates.jsonl`.
  First clean run recorded in
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19/quality-gate-enforcement-results.md` with
  all 12 per-variant verdicts PASS and a timestamp- + error_message-projected
  parity diff = 0. `cluster-19-e2e-test-plan.md` matrix row 5 now points at
  the results artifact.

- **E28-S135** Cluster 19 sprint-state-machine parity test. Added
  `tests/cluster-19-e2e/sprint-state-machine.bats` (9 bats cases covering all 7
  canonical states, every documented valid transition including the blocked
  branch and the `review → in-progress` rollback, and 5 canonical invalid
  transitions that must be rejected). Added the canonical exercise fixture
  under `plugins/gaia/test/fixtures/cluster-19/sprint-state-machine/seed/`
  (story + seed `sprint-status.yaml` + seed `story-index.yaml`, all registered
  with sha256 in `fixture-manifest.yaml`) and the parity oracle at
  `plugins/gaia/test/fixtures/parity-baseline/traces/sprint-state-machine.jsonl`.
  First clean run recorded in
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19/sprint-state-machine-results.md` with
  all 14 per-transition verdicts PASS and timestamp-projected parity diff = 0.
  `cluster-19-e2e-test-plan.md` matrix row 3 now points at the results artifact.

- **E28-S133** Cluster 19 full-lifecycle test runner. Added
  `plugins/gaia/test/runners/full-lifecycle.sh` — a script-driven (ADR-042)
  runner that drives the 10 canonical lifecycle stages (brainstorm →
  product-brief → PRD → UX → architecture → epics-stories → sprint-plan →
  dev-story → all-reviews → deploy-checklist) against the Cluster 19
  fixture at `plugins/gaia/test/fixtures/cluster-19/`. The runner produces
  per-stage artifacts, parity diff metadata under `runs/{run-id}/parity/`,
  and a dated evidence artifact at
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19-full-lifecycle-results-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
  with the AC4 schema (run metadata + stages table with
  `stage | skill | exit | artifact_path | sha256 | parity_verdict` +
  summary + regressions). Non-tolerated parity deltas append to
  `docs/implementation-artifacts/e28-s133-defects.yaml` and transition the
  story back to `in-progress` (AC5) pending E28-S140. Memory isolation
  (AC-EC7) is enforced via `GAIA_MEMORY_ROOT`; run-dir collision (AC-EC6)
  is guarded; secret-leak guard runs pre-write against the results artifact
  (AC-EC8). ATDD at
  `plugins/gaia/test/e28-s133-full-lifecycle-atdd.bats` exercises all 5
  acceptance criteria (AC1..AC5) including the `--seed-regression ordering`
  path that drives the defect-logging branch. First clean full-lifecycle
  run recorded 2026-04-17.

- **E28-S132** Authored the Cluster 19 integrated end-to-end test plan at
  `docs/test-artifacts/cluster-19-e2e-test-plan.md`. Defines the greenfield
  TypeScript/pnpm test project specification, the 7-category test matrix
  (full lifecycle, review gate, sprint state machine, checkpoint resume,
  quality gates, enterprise plugin, token measurement per NFR-048 40–55%
  reduction), binary pass/fail criteria with evidence artifacts and
  escalation rules per category, the full fixture inventory with
  sha256 immutability guarantees, and the review/approval workflow for
  AC5 gating. Scaffolded the fixture directory at
  `gaia-public/plugins/gaia/test/fixtures/cluster-19/` with a
  `fixture-manifest.yaml` stub listing every required fixture (placeholders
  populated by E28-S133..E28-S139). Added a pointer from test-plan.md
  §11.37 to the Cluster 19 plan (plan is the superset; §11.37 is the
  unit-of-parity subset). Plan unblocks the seven execution stories once
  Sable + Vera sign (AC5).

- **E28-S145** Cluster 20 test gate. Added `scripts/test-config-split.sh`, a
  shellcheck-clean, idempotent wrapper that drives
  `plugins/gaia/scripts/resolve-config.sh` across four project-structure
  fixtures (`root-project`, `subdir-project`, `no-shared-config`, live repo)
  plus an overlap-precedence fixture and a missing-key behavior check, then
  writes an authoritative test report to
  `docs/migration/config-split-test-report.md`. Exercises every acceptance
  criterion from the story: AC1 (project_path="."), AC2 (project_path="my-app"),
  AC3 (live repo zero drift), AC4 (backward-compat fallback with stderr
  silence), AC5 (report artifact cross-linked from
  `docs/migration/config-split.md`). 37 / 37 assertions pass on the current
  resolver. Non-zero exit on any fixture failure so CI can gate. Cluster 20
  green signal — Clusters 19 and 21 now have the config split as a verified
  foundation.

- **E28-S144** Migrated every SKILL.md that previously read `global.yaml` or
  `config/project-config.yaml` directly to use the canonical
  `!scripts/resolve-config.sh {key}` invocation from ADR-044 §10.26.3. Migrated
  skills: `gaia-sprint-plan` (sizing_map), `gaia-rollback-plan` (full config),
  `gaia-deploy-checklist` (ci_cd.promotion_chain), `gaia-val-validate-plan`
  (framework_version), `gaia-validation-patterns` (project_path doc reference).
  Config-editor skills (`gaia-bridge-toggle`, `gaia-bridge-enable`,
  `gaia-bridge-disable`, `gaia-ci-setup`, `gaia-ci-edit`) and the meta-validator
  (`gaia-validate-framework`) are allowlisted because they act ON the file
  rather than READ from it. Added two helper scripts:
  `plugins/gaia/scripts/audit-skill-config-reads.sh` (rerunnable audit) and
  `plugins/gaia/scripts/verify-no-direct-config-reads.sh` (CI invariant guard).
  Audit artifact checked in at `docs/migration/config-split-skill-audit.md`;
  skill migration section added to `docs/migration/config-split.md`. Zero
  behavioral drift — the resolver returns the same values the direct reads
  produced because the split preserves key names 1:1.

- **E28-S143** Added `plugins/gaia/scripts/migrate-config-split.sh`, a one-shot
  POSIX bash + `yq` helper that splits an existing `_gaia/_config/global.yaml`
  into the two-file layout from ADR-044 (`config/project-config.yaml` for
  team-shared fields + a rewritten machine-local `global.yaml`). Ships with
  backup-before-write (`.bak.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`), refusal on pre-existing shared
  file unless `--force`, `--dry-run` plan preview, and round-trip equivalence
  verification via `resolve-config.sh`. Classification mirrors the E28-S141
  disposition table. 14 bats tests across 6 fixtures (mixed / local-only /
  shared-only inputs, missing-yq guard, overwrite refusal, round-trip). See
  `docs/migration/config-split.md` for operator instructions and the rollback
  procedure.

#### Changed

- **E28-S142** `resolve-config.sh` now implements the two-file config split from ADR-044.
  The resolver reads the team-shared `config/project-config.yaml` first as a base layer,
  then overlays the machine-local `global.yaml` (via `--local <path>`), and finally applies
  `GAIA_*` environment overrides — final precedence is `env > local > shared`. Missing local
  or shared files degrade gracefully: the pre-split single-file invocation pattern is
  preserved via the `--config <path>` alias (equivalent to `--shared`) with an empty local
  layer. Required-field validation and the `project_path` traversal guard now run on the
  post-merge map, so security checks apply identically regardless of which layer contributed
  the value. Flattened-key merge (e.g., `val_integration.template_output_review`) uses
  last-writer-wins at the dotted-key level. Smoke harness extended with eight new TC cases
  and two AC-EC cases covering disjoint-key merges, overlapping-key overrides, local-only
  and shared-only fallbacks, env-wins precedence, malformed-YAML file naming, and
  shared-sourced traversal rejection. `scripts/tests/smoke-resolve-config.sh` now runs 24
  assertions, all green.

#### Documentation

- **E28-S32** Flipped orchestrator `project_path` from `Gaia-framework` to `gaia-public`,
  closing the final deferred step of E28-S4 (AC4 / Task 8). The flip was verified against
  the running `_gaia/_config/global.yaml`, stale resolved-config entries were regenerated,
  and a sample workflow resolution confirmed `{project-path}` now maps to
  `{project-root}/gaia-public`. Sprint 19 is now fully anchored on the `gaia-public` repo
  as the canonical GAIA product source.

- **E28-S28** Fix architecture version drift. Realigned downstream E28 story copy in
  `E28-S3-refresh-gaia-ground-truth.md` to reference `Architecture v1.20.0`, matching the
  authoritative on-disk frontmatter in `docs/planning-artifacts/architecture/architecture.md`. Resolution
  direction: Option B (revert story copy) — rejected Option A (bump arch to v1.21.0) because
  no real ADR delta justified a version bump. Ground-truth planning-baseline entry updated to
  record the resolution. This change is framework-internal (no public marketplace impact) but
  is logged here for sprint traceability.

- **E28-S27** Documented empirical Claude Code plugin component discovery rules in README —
  eight scanned subdirectories, strict lowercase casing, frontmatter requirements, kebab-case
  conventions, and seven observed edge cases.

- **E28-S26** Clarified in README that private marketplace authentication uses existing
  `gh auth` credentials — no Claude Code-specific auth layer is needed or planned.

- **E28-S24** Documented `/reload-plugins` requirement and marketplace cache recovery steps
  in README.

#### Features

- **E28-S25** Added `plugins/gaia/scripts/plugin-cache-recovery.sh` — guarded alternative to
  raw `rm -rf` of polluted marketplace cache entries. Validates slug, classifies cache state
  (absent / healthy / polluted), and refuses to remove a healthy clone without `--force`.

#### Foundation scripts (plugins/gaia/scripts/)

- **E28-S9** `resolve-config.sh` — deterministic config resolution replacing LLM-driven
  inheritance chains.
- **E28-S10** `checkpoint.sh` — atomic checkpoint writer with sha256 manifest.
- **E28-S12** `lifecycle-event.sh` — lifecycle event emitter.
- **E28-S13** `memory-loader.sh` — tier-aware agent sidecar loader.
- **E28-S14** `review-gate.sh` — canonical gate status reader/writer.
- **E28-S15** `validate-gate.sh` — composite gate validator.
- **E28-S16** `template-header.sh`, `next-step.sh`, `init-project.sh` — scaffold helpers.
- **E28-S18** `project-config.yaml` schema published under `plugins/gaia/config/`.
- **E28-S19** Subagent frontmatter schema enforced in `plugins/gaia/agents/`.
