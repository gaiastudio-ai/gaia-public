# verify-no-direct-config-reads.sh — E28-S144 CI guard (AC3, Task 3 / Task 5)
#
# Scans SKILL.md files for direct references to `global.yaml` or
# `project-config.yaml` and exits non-zero when any non-comment, non-allowlisted
# reference is found. Wire into CI to keep the invariant that all skill-level
# config reads flow through `scripts/resolve-config.sh` (ADR-044 §10.26.3).
#
# Exclusions (comments / docstrings / metadata):
#   - Lines inside HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`).
#   - Lines inside Markdown block-quotes where the reference is explanatory.
#
# Allowlist (config-editor / meta-validator skills that MUST reference the
# files directly because they act ON them rather than READ from them):
#   - gaia-bridge-toggle, gaia-bridge-enable, gaia-bridge-disable
#         — toggle test_execution_bridge.bridge_enabled in-place.
#   - gaia-ci-setup, gaia-ci-edit
#         — CRUD on ci_cd.promotion_chain in-place.
#   - gaia-validate-framework
#         — meta-validator; its purpose is to parse global.yaml end-to-end.
#
# These skills are architecturally unable to route through resolve-config.sh
# because resolve-config.sh is read-only and returns flattened key-value
# output, while the editors need to modify YAML in place preserving comments
# and formatting. Allowlisting them is the pragmatic ADR-044-aligned choice.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — clean (no direct reads outside the allowlist)
#   1 — violation detected; offending lines printed to stderr
#   2 — invalid argument (target dir missing)
#
# Usage:
#   verify-no-direct-config-reads.sh [SKILLS_DIR]
