# sprint-state.sh — GAIA foundation script
#
# Validates sprint state machine transitions, updates the story file
# frontmatter + body `**Status:**` line and `sprint-status.yaml` atomically,
# and emits a lifecycle event on every successful transition. Replaces the
# LLM-interpreted status-sync protocol with a deterministic, race-safe
# script.
#
# Invocation contract:
#
#   sprint-state.sh transition                 --story <key> --to <state>
#   sprint-state.sh get                        --story <key>
#   sprint-state.sh validate                   --story <key>
#   sprint-state.sh reconcile                  [--sprint-id <id>] [--dry-run]
#   sprint-state.sh lint-dependencies          [--sprint-id <id>] [--format json|text]

#
# Reconcile:
#   Scans story files under IMPLEMENTATION_ARTIFACTS to detect and correct
#   drift between authoritative story frontmatter (source of truth) and
#   the derivative sprint-status.yaml cache. Write boundary:
#   reconcile NEVER modifies story-file frontmatter — yaml only, routed
#   through the same allowlisted writer the transition path uses.
#   Exit codes: 0 = no drift or drift corrected; 2 = drift detected in
#   --dry-run; 1 = error (missing file / parse error / write failure).
#
# Canonical state set:
#   backlog | validating | ready-for-dev | in-progress | blocked | review | done
#
# Allowed story-level adjacency is defined by the shared SSOT at
# scripts/lib/story-state-machine.sh (STORY_ALLOWED_EDGES). This script
# sources that lib and delegates edge validation to validate_story_transition().
#
# Sprint-Status Write Safety (CRITICAL, per CLAUDE.md):
#   The story file is the source of truth — sprint-status.yaml is a derived
#   cached view. This script ALWAYS re-reads sprint-status.yaml under flock
#   immediately before writing. It updates both locations inside the same
#   critical section so no concurrent reader sees a drifted pair.
#
# Review Gate check on -> done:
#   Transitions to 'done' shell out to review-gate.sh status and require all
#   six canonical rows to report PASSED. Any other verdict (UNVERIFIED or
#   FAILED) blocks the transition with the offending row names enumerated.
#
# Config:
#   PROJECT_ROOT                — defaults to "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT:-${PROJECT_PATH:-.}}".
#                                 This is the directory containing `.gaia/` (and
#                                 `docs/` in legacy projects) per CLAUDE.md.
#                                 The runtime tree is resolved relative to it.
#   PROJECT_PATH                — defaults to ".". Application code paths only —
#                                 never the `.gaia/` tree. In a split-repo layout
#                                 (application code in a subdir, `.gaia/` at the
#                                 repo root) PROJECT_PATH and PROJECT_ROOT are
#                                 deliberately different; set PROJECT_ROOT
#                                 explicitly to point at the repo root.
#   IMPLEMENTATION_ARTIFACTS    — defaults to "${PROJECT_ROOT:+${PROJECT_ROOT%/}/}.gaia/artifacts/implementation-artifacts".
#   SPRINT_STATE_SCRIPT_DIR     — internal. Directory of this script, used to
#                                 locate sibling scripts (lifecycle-event.sh,
#                                 review-gate.sh). Override only in tests.
#
# Atomicity & concurrency:
#   All sprint-status.yaml writes are serialized by `flock -x -w 5` on a
#   sibling `sprint-status.yaml.lock` file. Every write (story file AND
#   sprint-status.yaml) is tempfile + atomic `mv`. The same critical section
#   covers:
#     1. read current status from story file
#     2. validate adjacency
#     3. re-read sprint-status.yaml
#     4. rewrite story file via tempfile + mv
#     5. rewrite sprint-status.yaml via tempfile + mv
#     6. emit lifecycle event
#   If step 6 fails the file writes are not rolled back, but the script exits
#   1 and surfaces the failure ("event failure surfaced with exit 1").
#   Subsequent `validate` will detect drift if any downstream consumer cares.
#
# POSIX discipline: the only non-POSIX constructs are [[ ]] and bash indexed
# arrays. macOS /bin/bash 3.2 compatible. Uses `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, `mktemp`,
# and optionally `flock` (graceful mv-based fallback when absent, same
# pattern as checkpoint.sh / lifecycle-event.sh / review-gate.sh).

Subcommands:
  init              Bootstrap a fresh sprint-status.yaml when none exists yet.
                    Seeds the canonical shape (sprint_id / status=planned /
                    total_points=0 / goals=[] / items=[]) under flock — a fresh
                    sprint starts in the `planned` state (planned → active →
                    review → closed). Idempotent — refuses to overwrite
                    an existing yaml. Required before the first `inject` in a
                    new project. Usage: sprint-state.sh init --sprint-id <id>.
                    After /gaia-sprint-close, the live yaml persists with
                    status=closed — init (and advance) re-seed over it.
  advance           Advance to the next sprint after closing the current one.
                    A thin, discoverable alias for `init` that makes the
                    close-to-next-sprint intent explicit. Requires the
                    predecessor sprint to be closed — refuses with a clear
                    message if the current sprint is not closed (directing the
                    operator to close it first). Delegates to the existing
                    init re-seed path (no duplicated seeding logic). Accepts
                    the same optional flags as init (--start-date, --end-date,
                    --sprint-length-days).
                    Usage: sprint-state.sh advance --sprint-id <next-id>.
  transition        Atomically transition a story to <state>. Validates
                    adjacency, re-reads sprint-status.yaml under flock,
                    rewrites story file frontmatter + body Status line +
                    sprint-status.yaml, and emits one lifecycle event.
                    Transitions to 'done' require all six Review Gate rows
                    to report PASSED (via review-gate.sh status).
  inject            Append a backlog story to the active sprint's
                    sprint-status.yaml. Requires the story file's
                    frontmatter sprint_id to match the yaml sprint_id
                    (drift guard). Idempotent — re-running on an already-
                    injected key is a no-op.
                    total_points: accumulated from the injected story's
                    frontmatter `points:` field — no --points CLI flag
                    is needed or accepted. Recomputes capacity_utilization
                    and emits one story_injected lifecycle event.
                    Boundary-write seed rule: when boundary-writing a
                    fresh sprint, seed total_points=0 — inject accumulates
                    onto the existing total; a non-zero seed produces
                    double-counted totals.
                    Used by /gaia-correct-course story-injection.
  get               Print the story's current status (from the story file)
                    to stdout and exit 0.
  validate          Compare story file status to sprint-status.yaml. Exit 0
                    if they agree, exit 1 with a drift description on stderr
                    if not.
  reconcile         Scan the target sprint's story files and reconcile
                    sprint-status.yaml to match authoritative frontmatter.
                    NEVER modifies story files. Exit 0 on no-drift or
                    drift-corrected, 2 on dry-run drift, 1 on error.
  lint-dependencies Read-only analysis of the selected sprint's dependency
                    graph. Detects forward-references (dependency inversions)
                    where a story depends on a resource created by a later
                    story in the sprint order.
                    Exit 0 = clean, 2 = inversions detected (advisory),
                    1 = error.
  detect-auto-close Read-only advisory probe. Emits a single-line JSON
                    payload on stdout when the active sprint has every story
                    at status=done with total_count>0 and top-level
                    status=active. Empty stdout when the auto-close
                    condition is not met. ALWAYS exits 0. NEVER mutates
                    sprint-status.yaml — the boundary write
                    (status=closed + next-sprint seed) remains a manual
                    operator action.

  transition --sprint  Sprint-level state-machine transitions. Edges:
                    active→review (gated on all-stories-done), review→closed,
                    review→correction, correction→active.
                    Refuses any other edge with `illegal sprint-level
                    transition: <from>→<to>`. Uses atomic mktemp + mv so
                    YAML comments and formatting are preserved.

  get-goals         Print the sprint's `goals[]` list (one per line) to
                    stdout. Empty output + exit 0 when no goals set.

  set-goals         REPLACE the sprint's `goals[]` list with the
                    pipe-delimited string passed via --goals "<g1|g2|...>".
                    Each goal is capped at 280 chars. Lossless round-trip
                    with get-goals.

  update-goals      Alias for set-goals (REPLACES; does not append).

  set-review-justification
                    Write the `review_justification:` block from a YAML
                    payload file (--file <path>) into sprint-status.yaml.
                    Required payload fields: primary_criterion ∈ {C1, C2, C3},
                    qualifying_story_points (int), total_story_points (int),
                    qualifying_ratio ≥ 0.80, explanation (200-1000 chars block
                    scalar). Existing block is replaced atomically.

# Read-only analysis of the selected sprint's story dependency graph.

# on a resource created by a later story in the sprint order.
#
# The AC text regex uses an 80-char co-occurrence window for trigger verb +
# target resource name matching. This bounds false positives from long-range
# coincidental matches while still catching same-sentence references.
#
# Read-only guarantee: lint-dependencies MUST NOT write to any file.
# It reads story files and sprint-status.yaml only. Safe for parallel CI
# pipelines and subagent invocation.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = clean, 2 = inversions detected (advisory), 1 = error.

# Outputs one dependency key per line. Returns empty for missing or empty
