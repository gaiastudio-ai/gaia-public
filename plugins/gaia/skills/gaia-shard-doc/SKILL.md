description: Split a large Markdown document into smaller files based on level-2 (H2) sections. Use when "shard this document" or /gaia-shard-doc. Preserves every byte of content, generates a linking index.md, and asks for user confirmation before writing files. Default split level is H2 — user can override to H1 or H3. Native Claude Code conversion of the legacy shard-doc task (E28-S111, Cluster 14).

## Mission

You are splitting one large Markdown document into multiple smaller shard files, one per section at the chosen heading level. The output is a directory named after the source file (without extension) containing the shards plus an `index.md` that links to each one. The default split level is `H2` (`##`); users may override to `H1` or `H3` via `$ARGUMENTS`.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy shard-doc task at `_gaia/core/tasks/shard-doc.xml` (brief Cluster 14, story E28-S111). The legacy 49-line XML body is preserved here as explicit prose per ADR-041. No workflow engine, no engine-specific XML step tags.

## Critical Rules

- **Default split level is H2 (`##`) — user can override to H1 or H3.** Pass `--level=H1` or `--level=H3` in `$ARGUMENTS`. Any other value fails with `shard-doc: invalid level '{value}' — expected H1, H2, or H3`.
- **Preserve ALL content — never drop text between sections.** Any content before the first split-level heading becomes `_preamble.md`. Every character of the source document must land in exactly one shard file.
- **Generate an index.md linking to all shards.** The index sits alongside the shard files inside the output directory and links to each shard with its heading text as the anchor.
- **Ask user for confirmation before writing files.** Show the preview plan (file list + line counts per shard) and wait for user confirmation. In YOLO or non-interactive mode, auto-proceed after previewing.
- **Handle the zero-headings edge case gracefully (AC-EC4).** If the source document contains zero headings at the split level (e.g., flat prose with no `##`), emit the message `no shard boundaries detected` and exit cleanly with zero shards written. Do NOT create empty shard files or an empty output directory.

## Inputs

1. **Source file** — from `$ARGUMENTS`. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user inline: "Which file should I shard?" and use the response as the source file path. Otherwise, use `$ARGUMENTS` as the target. This follows the inline-ask contract per ADR-066.
2. **Split level** — optional, via `--level=H1|H2|H3`. Default: `H2`. The level flag is parsed independently of the source-file argument; if the user supplies `--level=H3` with no source file, still ask "Which file should I shard?" inline.

**YOLO-mode interaction.** Per ADR-067, inline-ask on empty `$ARGUMENTS` is an open-question indicator — YOLO mode HALTS here for user input. There is no safe default target file, so the user must provide one. This differs from the Step 3 (Preview Plan) confirmation prompt, which IS auto-proceeded in YOLO mode.

## Pipeline Overview

The skill runs five steps in strict order, mirroring the legacy `shard-doc.xml`:

1. **Load Source** — read and count
2. **Parse Sections** — identify split boundaries, derive filenames
3. **Preview Plan** — show the plan and confirm
4. **Write Shards** — create the output directory and emit each shard + index
5. **Report** — summarize shards created

## Step 1 — Load Source

- Resolve the source file path from `$ARGUMENTS`. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user inline: "Which file should I shard?" and use the response as the source file path (per ADR-066). In YOLO mode, this inline-ask still halts for input — there is no safe default file (per ADR-067).
- Read the entire source file; count total lines and sections at each heading level.

## Step 2 — Parse Sections

- Identify all sections at the split level (default `##`; overridable via `--level`).
- **Preamble:** any content before the first split-level heading becomes `_preamble.md`. If there is no content before the first heading, omit the preamble file.
- Generate a filename for each section from its heading text:
  1. Lowercase
  2. Replace spaces and punctuation with hyphens
  3. Remove special characters (anything not alphanumeric or hyphen)
  4. Collapse multiple consecutive hyphens into a single hyphen
  5. Trim leading / trailing hyphens
  6. Prefix with zero-padded section number: `01-section-name.md`, `02-next-section.md`
- **AC-EC4 — zero headings at the split level:** if the source contains no split-level headings, emit `no shard boundaries detected` and exit cleanly. Do NOT create an empty output directory.

## Step 3 — Preview Plan

- Show the user the planned file list with per-file line counts:
  ```
  _preamble.md              12 lines
  01-introduction.md        48 lines
  02-architecture.md        94 lines
  ...
  index.md                   N lines (auto-generated)
  ```
- Ask for confirmation. If the user adjusts the plan (renames, reorders, merges shards), update accordingly.
- In YOLO or non-interactive mode, proceed after displaying the preview.

## Step 4 — Write Shards

- Create the output directory — same path as the source file with the extension stripped (e.g., `docs/planning-artifacts/prd.md` → `docs/planning-artifacts/prd/`). Use `!` inline bash for `mkdir -p` per ADR-042.
- Write each shard file: the section heading becomes the first line of the shard, and every line from that heading through the line before the next split-level heading goes into the shard.
- Write `index.md` with a table of contents linking every shard with its heading text, sorted by the numeric prefix.

## Step 5 — Report

- Report: number of shards created, total lines distributed (verify it equals the source line count — parity check), whether `_preamble.md` was emitted.
- Suggest running `/gaia-index-docs` on the parent directory to update the folder-level index, if one exists.

## Edge Cases

- **AC-EC4 — zero headings at the split level:** emit `no shard boundaries detected`; do not create any shard files; do not create the output directory.
- **Source file not found:** fail fast with a clear message.
- **Output directory already exists:** overwrite its contents after user confirmation. A byte-level diff on repeated runs of the same source must produce zero changes.
- **Heading slug collision:** if two sections produce the same slug, disambiguate with `-2`, `-3` suffixes.
