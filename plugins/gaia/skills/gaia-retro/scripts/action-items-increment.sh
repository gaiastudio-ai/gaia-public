#!/usr/bin/env bash
# action-items-increment.sh — increment escalation_count for an action-items.yaml
# entry keyed by theme_hash, with idempotency scoped to (sprint_id, theme_hash).
#
# E36-S5 / ADR-052: this script delegates to the canonical shared retro writer
# (retro-sidecar-write.sh) for allowlist enforcement, path resolution, and
# concurrency control. Helpers (allowlist_match, resolve_real) are sourced
# directly from the shared writer so the NFR-RIM-2 boundary is enforced
# exactly once across the codebase.
#
# Increment semantics are an in-place YAML mutation, distinct from the
# shared writer's append-only pipeline — that mutation logic stays here, but
# all auxiliary primitives (boundary, locking, backup) come from the shared
# writer.
#
# Usage:
#   action-items-increment.sh --file <path> --theme-hash <hex> --sprint-id <id>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — increment applied (or no-op because already applied for this sprint,
#        or target file missing — increment is a non-fatal warning)
#   1  — error (allowlist rejection, invalid arguments, IO failure)
#
# Contract:
#   * Allowlist check: file path must satisfy the shared writer's allowlist
#     (realpath-resolved match against NFR-RIM-2 patterns; for this script,
#     the relevant pattern is `<root>/docs/planning-artifacts/action-items.yaml`).
#   * Idempotency: a sidecar ledger next to the target file records
#     (sprint_id, theme_hash) pairs that have already produced an increment.
#     Re-invoking with the same pair is a silent no-op.
#   * Backup: a .bak copy is written before mutation; on verify failure the
#     target is restored from .bak; on success .bak is removed.
#   * Concurrency: flock on the target file serializes writers (AC-EC1, AC-EC9).
