# finalize.sh — /gaia-ci-setup skill finalize
#
# Extends the finalize scaffolding with an 8-item post-completion checklist
# (6 script-verifiable + 2 LLM-checkable) derived from the V1 ci-setup
# checklist (see the docs/v1-v2-command-gap-analysis.md entry for the
# verbatim V1 source).
#
# The unconditional `validate-gate.sh ci_setup_exists` post-check was removed
# because this skill IS the producer of .gaia/artifacts/test-artifacts/ci-setup.md;
# a post-check on the producer's own output is tautological.
#
# Responsibilities:
#   1. Run the script-verifiable subset of the 8 checklist items
#      against the ci-setup.md artifact. Validation runs FIRST.
#   2. Emit an LLM-checkable payload listing the semantic-judgment items.
#   3. Write a checkpoint via the shared checkpoint.sh helper.
#   4. Emit a lifecycle event via lifecycle-event.sh.
#
# The observability side effects (3 + 4) MUST run on every invocation —
# the checklist outcome never suppresses the checkpoint/event write.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — finalize succeeded; all 6 script-verifiable items PASS (or
#       no artifact was requested — classic skip behaviour).
#   1 — one or more script-verifiable checklist items FAIL; the
#       "no artifact to validate" violation; or a
#       checkpoint/lifecycle-event failure. Failed item names are
#       listed on stderr under a "Checklist violations:" header
#       followed by a one-line remediation hint.
#
# Environment:
#   CI_SETUP_ARTIFACT  Absolute path to the ci-setup.md artifact to
#                      validate. When set, the script runs the 8-item
#                      checklist against it. When set but the file
#                      does not exist or is empty, a "no artifact to
#                      validate" violation is emitted and the script
#                      exits non-zero. When unset, the script skips
#                      the checklist (observability still runs,
#                      exit 0).
