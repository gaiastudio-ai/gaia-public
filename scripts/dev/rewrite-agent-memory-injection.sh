#
# Rewrites each subagent .md file under plugins/gaia/agents/ so that:
#   1. The existing `## Memory` section's loader line switches from the `all`
#      tier to the `ground-truth` tier (per ADR-046 Path 1).
#   2. The `## Memory` block is relocated to sit AFTER the agent's
#      persona/identity block and BEFORE the first behavioural section
#      (`## Rules` by convention, falling back to the next `## ` heading).
#
# Surgical: only the `## Memory` section and loader line are touched; all
# other content (persona prose, rules, skills, scope, DoD) is preserved.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run — if the Memory section is already in the
# correct position with the ground-truth tier, no change is made.
#
# Scope: runs on every *.md file in plugins/gaia/agents/ except _SCHEMA.md.
