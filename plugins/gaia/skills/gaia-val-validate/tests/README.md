# Val Auto-Fix Loop — Test Runbooks (E44-S2)

LLM-checkable runbooks for the Val Auto-Fix Loop Pattern (canonical spec in
`../SKILL.md` § "Auto-Fix Loop Pattern"). Implements ADR-058 / FR-344 /
NFR-VCP-2 (E44-S2). The companion script-verifiable bats coverage lives at
`plugins/gaia/tests/e44-s2-val-auto-fix-loop-pattern.bats`.

These runbooks are executed by the broader VCP test orchestrator (not bats).
Each runbook describes setup, the exact invocation sequence, and the
assertion the orchestrator verifies after the run.

## How To Run

These runbooks are not executed by `bats`. They are consumed by the VCP test
orchestrator (or executed manually by a developer running through the steps
in a forked Claude Code conversation). Each runbook is structured so that
the assertion at the bottom is mechanically checkable from the resulting
artifact, checkpoint, and iteration log.

The companion bats file `e44-s2-val-auto-fix-loop-pattern.bats` covers the
spec-encoding side: that the SKILL.md actually documents the pattern, the
prompt verbatim, the severity contract, the YOLO invariant, the checkpoint
custom-namespace key, and the token-budget targets. The runbooks here cover
the runtime side: that an actual loop run obeys the documented contract.
