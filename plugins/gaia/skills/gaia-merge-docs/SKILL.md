## Mission

You are merging multiple Markdown files into a single document. This is the inverse of `/gaia-shard-doc`. Inputs may be (a) a directory of sharded files produced by a previous `shard-doc` run, or (b) an explicit list of file paths. The output is a single Markdown artifact at the user-specified path with consistent heading hierarchy and resolved cross-references.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy merge-docs task at `_gaia/core/tasks/merge-docs.xml` (brief Cluster 14, story E28-S111). The legacy 34-line XML body is preserved here as explicit prose per ADR-041. No workflow engine, no engine-specific XML step tags.

## Critical Rules

- **Preserve section numbering and cross-references.** Any numbered section (`## 1. Introduction`, `## 2. Background`) retains its number after merge. Inline cross-references (`see §3.1`) continue to resolve to the correct section in the merged output.
- **Maintain consistent heading hierarchy.** After merge, all top-level headings are at the same level (typically `##` when shards were H2-rooted). Sub-sections nest one level deeper. Never emit a document with inconsistent heading depth.
- **Reassemble in correct order.** For directory inputs, use the filename prefix order (e.g., `01-intro.md`, `02-background.md`, `03-scope.md`). For explicit file lists, use the order provided by the user.
- **Fail fast on an empty input list (AC-EC5).** If no docs are provided (empty directory, empty list), emit `usage: /gaia-merge-docs <input-list>` and exit non-zero. Never produce an empty output artifact.
- **Resolve cross-references to anchors.** File-based links (`[see intro](./01-intro.md)`) are rewritten to section anchors (`[see intro](#intro)`) in the merged artifact — the links must stay valid inside the single merged document.

## Inputs

1. **Source** — from `$ARGUMENTS`. Either (a) a directory containing sharded files or (b) a comma-separated list of file paths.
2. **Output path** — user-specified. If omitted, default to `{source-dir}/merged.md` when input is a directory, or ask the user otherwise.

## Pipeline Overview

The skill runs four steps in strict order, mirroring the legacy `merge-docs.xml`:

1. **Identify Source Files** — resolve inputs, determine correct ordering
2. **Validate Structure** — check heading consistency, identify cross-references
3. **Merge** — reassemble in order, fix cross-refs, add TOC
4. **Output** — write the merged document

## Step 1 — Identify Source Files

- Read `$ARGUMENTS` or prompt the user for the directory or file list to merge.
- If the input is a directory: list all `.md` files and order them by filename prefix (e.g., `01-*`, `02-*`, `_preamble.md` first if present).
- If the input is an explicit list: use the order provided.
- Read every source file into memory (for this step's validation).
- **AC-EC5 — empty input list:** if zero source files are resolved, fail fast with `usage: /gaia-merge-docs <input-list>` and exit non-zero.

## Step 2 — Validate Structure

- Check that heading levels are consistent across files. For example, if shards were H2-rooted, every file should start with `## Heading`. Flag any file starting at a different level.
- Identify cross-references between sections: scan each file for `[text](./other-file.md)` and `see §N` style links.
- Resolve any numbering conflicts: if two files both claim `## 1. Title`, renumber the second occurrence to keep ordering consistent.

## Step 3 — Merge

- Reassemble the files in the order resolved in Step 1.
- Add a document header (title derived from the source directory name or user-provided) and a Table of Contents linking to each section anchor.
- Fix cross-references to use section anchors (`#section-slug`) instead of file links (`./other-file.md`). Every file-based link becomes an in-document anchor link.
- Preserve all content verbatim between headings — the merge is lossless.

## Step 4 — Output

- Write the merged document to the user-specified output path.
- Report the merge summary: number of files merged, total line count, any headings that were renumbered, any cross-references that could not be resolved.

## Edge Cases

- **AC-EC5 — empty input list:** fail fast with `usage: /gaia-merge-docs <input-list>`; no empty output artifact.
- **Duplicate heading IDs:** append a `-2`, `-3` suffix to the anchor ID to maintain link uniqueness.
- **Missing files in a declared file list:** report each missing file as a warning; continue the merge with the files that do exist.
