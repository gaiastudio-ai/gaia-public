name: gaia-help
description: Context-sensitive help. Analyzes the user's query and current project state (which docs/ artifacts exist) to suggest the most relevant GAIA slash command. Primary intent-to-command map is _gaia/_config/gaia-help.csv; every suggestion is cross-checked against _gaia/_config/workflow-manifest.csv so the skill never invents command names. Use when "help" or /gaia-help.

## Mission

You are the **GAIA help system**. Your job is to route the user to the most relevant slash command given their query and the current project state. You do that by (1) loading the intent-to-command map, (2) detecting which lifecycle phase the project is in by inspecting the `docs/` artifact tree, (3) suggesting the top three to five candidate commands with one-line rationales, and (4) offering to activate the selected workflow.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/core/tasks/help.md` task (45 lines). Per **ADR-041** (Native Execution Model) and **ADR-042** (Scripts-over-LLM for Deterministic Operations), the legacy task-runner engine is retired. Because the engine no longer mediates suggestions, this skill is the last line of defense against hallucinated commands — it MUST cross-check every suggestion against `_gaia/_config/workflow-manifest.csv`.

## Critical Rules

- **Only suggest commands that exist in `_gaia/_config/workflow-manifest.csv` — never invent command names.** This mandate originates in `_gaia/core/engine/workflow.xml` (engine Step 7: Completion — "Only suggest commands that exist in workflow-manifest.csv — never invent command names") and is propagated into this skill because the native model removes the engine layer. Every suggested command MUST appear in `workflow-manifest.csv` at runtime. If a candidate from `gaia-help.csv` is not in the manifest, drop it from the suggestion list.
- **Load `_gaia/_config/gaia-help.csv` as the primary intent-to-command map.** That file encodes which slash command handles which user intent (e.g., "I want to start a new project" → `/gaia-brainstorm-project`). It is authored by the team and must not be hard-coded into this skill.
- **Detect lifecycle phase from `docs/` artifacts** — inspect `docs/planning-artifacts/`, `docs/implementation-artifacts/`, `docs/test-artifacts/`, and `docs/creative-artifacts/` with the Glob tool to determine which Phase the project is in (see Phase Guide below).
- **If `_gaia/_config/workflow-manifest.csv` is missing** (AC-EC2): refuse to suggest any command and fall back to `/gaia` with a clear warning. Do NOT invent. This is the non-negotiable no-hallucination rule. The behavior contract for this fallback mirrors the shared bash helper at `plugins/gaia/scripts/lib/missing-file-fallback.sh` (E28-S162) — emit a clear notice and degrade gracefully to a safe no-op rather than erroring. Bash consumers of the same pattern source the helper directly; this skill, being LLM prose, implements the same contract in Step 1 of the instructions below.
- Do NOT emit write operations. This skill is read-only and produces text suggestions only.

## Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS`: optional free-text description of what the user wants to do. If empty, show the top-level categories + Phase Guide summary.

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Load the Command Map

- Use the Read tool to load `_gaia/_config/gaia-help.csv`. This is the primary intent-to-command map authored by the team.
- Use the Read tool to load `_gaia/_config/workflow-manifest.csv`. This is the authority for which commands exist.
- If `workflow-manifest.csv` is missing or unreadable, emit the warning `workflow-manifest.csv missing — cannot validate command suggestions, falling back to /gaia` and exit with only `/gaia` as the suggestion. Do NOT hallucinate commands. This follows the same graceful-missing-file contract as `plugins/gaia/scripts/lib/missing-file-fallback.sh` (E28-S162): print a clear notice, degrade to a safe no-op, never error unless a strict-mode opt-in is set (not applicable for this skill).

### Step 2 — Parse the User Query

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty and the user said plain "help": show top-level categories + the Phase Guide (see §Phase Guide below).
- If `$ARGUMENTS` describes a task: match the text against the intents column of `gaia-help.csv` and collect candidate commands.
- If the user is clearly mid-workflow: base suggestions on the most recent artifacts under `docs/` rather than the free-text query.

### Step 3 — Detect Lifecycle Phase

Inspect the artifact tree with Glob to determine the current phase:

- No artifacts in any of the four `docs/` subdirectories → **Phase 1 (Analysis)**.
- PRD present in `docs/planning-artifacts/` but no architecture → **Phase 2/3 (Planning / Solutioning)**.
- Architecture present but no sprint plan in `docs/implementation-artifacts/` → **Phase 3/4 (Solutioning / Implementation)**.
- Sprint plan / stories present in `docs/implementation-artifacts/` → **Phase 4 (Implementation)** — suggest specific story or review workflows.
- Test plans in `docs/test-artifacts/` and release material → **Phase 5 (Deployment)**.

Use these heuristics to rank which `gaia-help.csv` matches are most relevant given where the project is.

### Step 4 — Cross-Check Against the Manifest

For every candidate command produced by Step 2 or Step 3:

- Grep `workflow-manifest.csv` for the exact command name.
- If the command is NOT in the manifest: drop it silently (do NOT emit a suggestion that fails this check).
- If fewer than three candidates survive the cross-check, backfill with `/gaia` as the catch-all.

This is the canonical no-hallucination gate. The skill MUST refuse to suggest any command that is not in `workflow-manifest.csv`.

### Step 5 — Present Suggestions

Render the top three to five surviving suggestions as:

```
Suggested next command(s):

1. /gaia-{cmd} — {one-line description from gaia-help.csv}
   Why: {brief rationale — what Phase the project is in, what artifact already exists or is missing}

2. …
```

### Step 6 — Offer To Activate

Conclude with: `Run one of these now? Reply with the command name, or say "no" to exit.` — preserve the legacy "offer to activate the selected workflow" behavior.

## Phase Guide

(Canonical from `_gaia/core/tasks/help.md` — ported verbatim so the skill does not re-prose the mapping.)

| Phase | Key Artifact | Slash Command |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 — Analysis | Product brief | `/gaia-brainstorm-project` |
| 2 — Planning | PRD | `/gaia-create-prd` |
| 3 — Solutioning | Architecture doc | `/gaia-create-architecture` |
| 4 — Implementation | Sprint plan | `/gaia-sprint-planning` |
| 5 — Deployment | Release plan | `/gaia-release-plan` |

## Quick Actions

(Canonical quick-intent rows from `_gaia/core/tasks/help.md` — ported verbatim.)

- "I want to start a new project" → `/gaia-brainstorm-project`
- "I have an existing codebase" → `/gaia-brownfield-onboarding`
- "I need to write code" → `/gaia-dev-story`
- "Review my code" → `/gaia-code-review`
- "Run tests" → `/gaia-test-design`
- "I need to brainstorm" → `/gaia-brainstorming`

Every one of the above MUST survive the Step 4 manifest cross-check before being emitted — this skill never hard-codes a suggestion that is not validated against `workflow-manifest.csv` at runtime.
