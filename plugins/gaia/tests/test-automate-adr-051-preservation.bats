# test-automate-adr-051-preservation.bats — skill-specific assertions for E65-S5
#
# Verifies the hybrid migration of gaia-test-automate to the seven-phase
# Evidence/Judgment template DOES NOT regress the ADR-051 plan-then-execute
# split-phase contract. The standard evidence-judgment-parity.bats covers the
# five S1-AC7 invariants (allowed-tools, principle, phases, persona, resolver);
# this supplemental suite covers the ADR-051-specific contract that is unique
# to gaia-test-automate among the six review skills (TC-ADR051-PRESERVATION-01).
