## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-tech-research/scripts/setup.sh

## Mission

You are conducting a technical research session. Guide the user through technology scoping, evaluation, and trade-off analysis, then emit a structured technical research report at `docs/planning-artifacts/technical-research.md` for downstream consumers (e.g., `/gaia-product-brief`, `/gaia-create-arch`).

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/lifecycle/workflows/1-analysis/technical-research` workflow (brief §Cluster 4, story P4-S4). The step ordering, prompts, and output location follow the legacy `instructions.xml` mechanically — do not restructure, re-prompt, or reorder sections.

## Critical Rules

- Check web access availability before proceeding with research.
- If no web access, proceed with user-provided data and general knowledge only.
- Provide objective trade-off analysis, not technology advocacy.
- The output file path is `docs/planning-artifacts/technical-research.md` — downstream consumers read this exact path, so do not relocate it.
- Mechanical port: the five legacy steps below must appear in this exact order.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Technology Scoping

Ask the user, in order, and wait for a response on each:

- **"What technologies or tech stack do you want to research?"**
- **"What is the use case or problem context?"**
- **"Are there constraints (team expertise, budget, timeline)?"**

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-tech-research 1 technology="$TECHNOLOGY" evaluation_criteria="$EVALUATION_CRITERIA"`

### Step 2 — Web Access Check

- Check if MCP web tools are available for live research.
- If web access is available, proceed with live web research in subsequent steps.
- If no web access, notify the user: *"Web access unavailable. Proceeding with user-provided data and general knowledge. Results may be less comprehensive."*

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-tech-research 2 technology="$TECHNOLOGY" evaluation_criteria="$EVALUATION_CRITERIA"`

### Step 3 — Technology Evaluation

- Assess each technology for: maturity, community size, learning curve, licensing.
- Evaluate ecosystem: libraries, tools, IDE support, documentation quality.
- Check production readiness: stability, performance characteristics, scalability.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-tech-research 3 technology="$TECHNOLOGY" evaluation_criteria="$EVALUATION_CRITERIA"`

### Step 4 — Trade-off Analysis

- Create pros/cons matrix for each technology option.
- Compare alternatives across key dimensions.
- Provide recommendation with clear rationale.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-tech-research 4 technology="$TECHNOLOGY" evaluation_criteria="$EVALUATION_CRITERIA"`

### Step 5 — Generate Output

Write a structured technical research report to `docs/planning-artifacts/technical-research.md` containing, in order:

- **Technology Overview** — summary of each evaluated technology
- **Evaluation Matrix** — maturity, community, learning curve, licensing, ecosystem, production readiness
- **Trade-off Analysis** — pros/cons matrix and cross-dimensional comparison
- **Recommendation** — recommended technology with clear rationale
- **Migration / Adoption Considerations** — timeline, team ramp-up, risk factors

## Validation

<!--
  E42-S4 — V1→V2 22-item checklist port (FR-341, FR-359).
  Classification (22 items total):
    - Script-verifiable: 13 (SV-01..SV-13) — enforced by finalize.sh.
    - LLM-checkable:      9 (LLM-01..LLM-09) — evaluated by the host LLM
      against the technical-research artifact below.
  Exit code 0 when all script-verifiable items PASS; non-zero otherwise.
  Dedup / expand rule applied to the V1 surface (2 validation-rules +
  11 checkboxes = 13 V1 items, expanded to 22 as follows):
    - "At least 2 alternatives compared" (V1 validation-rule) becomes
      SV-12, the AC2 anchor — backed by the alternatives_count helper
      in finalize.sh and guarded by VCP-CHK-08.
    - "Trade-off analysis included" (V1 validation-rule) splits into
      section-present (SV-09 ## Trade-off Analysis) and matrix-populated
      (SV-13 pros/cons matrix included) so an empty heading cannot
      spoof a PASS.
    - V1 Scope (Technologies / Use case / Constraints) maps 1:1 to
      SV-04, SV-05, SV-06.
    - V1 Evaluation (Maturity / Community / Licensing) is reclassified
      as LLM-checkable (LLM-02, LLM-03, LLM-04) because assessing
      accuracy requires semantic judgement, not keyword matching.
    - V1 Trade-offs (Pros/cons matrix / Alternatives compared /
      Recommendation rationale) split: matrix presence → SV-13,
      alternatives count → SV-12, rationale quality → LLM-06.
    - V1 Output Verification ("All required sections present") expands
      into one check per V2 Step 5 required section — Technology
      Overview (SV-07), Evaluation Matrix (SV-08), Trade-off Analysis
      (SV-09), Recommendation (SV-10), Migration/Adoption (SV-11) —
      so each section fails independently rather than as a single
      binary.
    - Web Access checkboxes from V1 fold into LLM-08 (semantic check
      on the limitation wording).
    - Observability items (non-empty artifact, frontmatter/title)
      surface as SV-02 and SV-03 so automated infrastructure can catch
      empty or malformed outputs before humans review them.
  See docs/implementation-artifacts/E42-S4-port-gaia-tech-research-22-item-checklist-to-v2.md.
