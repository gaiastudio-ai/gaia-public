# yield-gate.sh — write the canonical yield-boundary session-state side
# effects at any of the five `/gaia-meeting` yield boundaries.
#
# History
# -------
# - Original implementation installed the canonical 3-line stdout block
#   (phase marker + prompt + a turn-terminal stdout sentinel) as the
#   script-side turn-terminal mechanism. The intent was to move
#   yield-boundary enforcement from prose-side LLM discipline to script-side.
# - Subsequent amendment — empirical verification showed the stdout sentinel
#   was defeated by harness Auto Mode; the harness does not stop on stdout
#   content. The yield-boundary contract was amended: yield boundaries now use
#   the substrate `AskUserQuestion` primitive, which halts the LLM turn at the
#   substrate level regardless of Auto Mode. This script no longer emits the
#   3-line stdout block. It RETAINS the session-state side-effect writes —
#   those remain the source of truth for `--resume` re-entry consistency. The
#   orchestrator (SKILL.md §Procedure prose) emits the AskUserQuestion call
#   AFTER this helper writes its side effects.
#
# Usage:
#   yield-gate.sh --phase <p> --session-id <id> [--side-effect-only]
#
# The `--side-effect-only` flag is accepted for forward-compatibility and is
# the DEFAULT behaviour — the flag is a no-op vs. the default invocation. It
# exists so SKILL.md procedure prose can explicitly document the
# side-effect-only intent at every yield boundary.
#
# Phase enum:
#   post-charter, post-research, discuss-cadence, pre-close, pre-save
#
# Side effects (the only effects this helper produces):
#   session-state.sh update --field last_checkpoint_phase --value <phase>
#   session-state.sh update --field last_yield_emitted_at --value <iso8601-utc>
#
# Output:
#   none — the helper writes ZERO bytes to stdout. The stdout-sentinel
#   emission was removed. The substrate-correct user-facing prompt mechanism
#   is the LLM-emitted `AskUserQuestion` tool call rendered AFTER this helper
#   completes.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = success
#   2 = malformed args (unknown phase, empty/missing session-id, unknown flag)
