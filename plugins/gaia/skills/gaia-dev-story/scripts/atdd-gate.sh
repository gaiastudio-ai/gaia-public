#!/usr/bin/env bash
# atdd-gate.sh — gaia-dev-story Step 2b ATDD gate
#
# Purpose:
#   For high-risk stories, halt the dev-story workflow at Step 2b unless an
#   ATDD scenarios file exists under .gaia/artifacts/test-artifacts/. For non-high-risk
#   stories, exit 0 unconditionally.
#
# The canonical glob set is:
#   .gaia/artifacts/test-artifacts/atdd-{epic_key}*.md   — epic-level ATDD coverage
#   .gaia/artifacts/test-artifacts/atdd-{story_key}*.md  — story-level ATDD coverage
# Either glob matching at least one file satisfies the gate.
#
# Field-name alias note: the canonical story template uses `risk:` in
# frontmatter. Some documentation refers to `risk_level` — these are
# the same semantic field on the target story being processed by
# /gaia-dev-story. This script reads the canonical `risk:` line; if it is
# absent we also scan for `risk_level:` for forward compatibility.
#
# Usage:
#   atdd-gate.sh <story_key>
#
# Environment:
#   PROJECT_PATH — optional. Project root containing docs/. Defaults to the
#                  current working directory.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — gate passes (non-high risk, OR high-risk with at least one ATDD file)
#   1 — gate halts  (high-risk story with no matching ATDD file)
#   2 — usage error (missing story_key, missing story file, etc.)
