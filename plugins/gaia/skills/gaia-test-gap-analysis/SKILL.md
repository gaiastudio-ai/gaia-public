## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-test-gap-analysis/scripts/setup.sh

## Mission

You are performing a test gap analysis to identify untested or under-tested areas in the project. You scan the test plan and story files to find acceptance criteria that lack corresponding test cases, calculate per-module and aggregate coverage percentages, and produce a gap analysis report following the FR-223 schema.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/testing/workflows/test-gap-analysis` workflow (Cluster 11, story E28-S84, ADR-042). It follows the canonical skill pattern established by E28-S66 (code-review).

**Fork context semantics (ADR-041, ADR-045):** This skill runs under `context: fork` with read-only tools (`Read Grep Glob Bash`). It CANNOT modify files -- the tool allowlist enforces NFR-048 (no-write isolation). Do NOT attempt to call Write or Edit. The gap analysis report is printed to conversation output for the caller to persist.

**Dual-mode operation:** This skill supports two modes:
- `coverage` (default) -- scans acceptance criteria against test plan to identify gaps
- `verification` -- cross-references generated test cases against execution results (JUnit XML, LCOV, E17 evidence JSON)

## Critical Rules

- A mode argument is optional. If omitted, default to `coverage` mode.
- If `--mode` is provided, it MUST be one of `coverage` or `verification`. Fail fast with "usage: /gaia-test-gap-analysis [--mode coverage|verification]" on invalid mode.
- This skill is READ-ONLY. Do NOT attempt to call Write or Edit tools -- the fork context allowlist enforces this.
- NFR-040 constraint: the analysis MUST complete within 60 seconds. Log execution time in the report footer.
- Output MUST follow the FR-223 schema: Executive Summary, Per-Module Coverage table, Per-Story Detail, Gap Table.
- When no gaps are detected, output MUST state "No coverage gaps detected" with gap count of 0 and coverage rate of 100%.
- Sprint-status.yaml is NEVER written by this skill (Sprint-Status Write Safety rule).
- When gaps are found, emit the completion nudge: "Run `/gaia-fill-test-gaps` to remediate these gaps now." (E19-S28 AC1/FR-315). Display-only, never auto-invokes.

## Steps

### Step 1 -- Determine Mode

- Check the argument for `--mode coverage` or `--mode verification`.
- If no mode specified, default to `coverage` mode.
- If mode is `coverage`, proceed to Step 2 (coverage mode steps).
- If mode is `verification`, proceed to Step 7 (verification mode steps).

### Step 2 -- Scan Test Plan (Coverage Mode)

- Read `docs/test-artifacts/test-plan.md`.
- Extract all test case IDs and their linked story keys from the test plan.
- Build a map of `test_case_id -> [story_keys]` for cross-referencing.
- If `test-plan.md` is missing, log warning: "test-plan.md not found -- partial coverage analysis only" and continue with empty test case map (AC-EC1).

### Step 3 -- Scan Story Files (Coverage Mode)

- Scan all story files in `docs/implementation-artifacts/` matching pattern `*-*.md`.
- For each story file, extract all acceptance criteria (AC items) from the "Acceptance Criteria" section.
- Build a map of `story_key -> [AC items]` with their identifiers (AC1, AC2, etc.).
- Track untested acceptance criteria -- ACs that have no matching test case in the test plan map.

### Step 4 -- Cross-Reference and Identify Gaps (Coverage Mode)

- For each story's acceptance criteria, check if a corresponding test case exists in the test plan.
- Flag each AC as `covered` (has test case) or `uncovered-ac` (no test case found).
- Calculate coverage rate per story: `covered_ACs / total_ACs`.
- Calculate overall coverage percentage across all stories using the shared helper `scripts/lib/coverage-calc.js` when available (E19-S25). If the helper is unavailable, compute inline with banker's rounding to one decimal place.

### Step 4b -- Frontend Dimensions Analysis (Coverage Mode, Conditional)

- Detect project type via `scripts/lib/project-type-detection.js` if available. If `result.type` is `frontend`, `fullstack`, or `mobile`, set `is_frontend=true`. Otherwise skip this step entirely.
- If `is_frontend == true`: for each of the six architectural dimensions (Unit Tests, E2E Tests, Cross-browser, Accessibility, Visual Regression, Responsive/Viewport), scan the project and compute gap_count, coverage_score 0-100%, and top 3 uncovered items per ADR-030 section 10.22.3 and FR-224.
- If `is_frontend == false`: skip. Do NOT emit a "## Frontend Dimensions" section.

### Step 4c -- Per-Module Coverage Calculation (Coverage Mode)

- Group all scanned story files by epic key (from `epic:` frontmatter field).
- For each epic group, count `total_acs`, `tested_acs`, and `gap_count`.
- Calculate per-epic and aggregate coverage percentages using `scripts/lib/coverage-calc.js` as the single source of truth (E19-S25). If unavailable, compute inline.
- Sort per-module table by `coverage_pct` ascending (lowest first); break ties by epic key lexicographic ascending.
- Exclude epics with zero story files from the per-module table.

### Step 5 -- Generate Coverage Output (FR-223 Schema)

- Generate the gap analysis report with the following FR-223 schema sections:
  - **Executive Summary** -- total stories analyzed, ACs scanned, gaps found, overall coverage percentage
  - **Per-Module Coverage** -- table with columns: module, total_acs, tested_acs, coverage_pct, gap_count
  - **Per-Story Detail** -- each story with its ACs and coverage status
  - **Gap Table** -- listing each uncovered AC with story_key, gap_type, severity, description
- If zero gaps detected: "No coverage gaps detected" in summary with gap count 0 and coverage 100%.
- Print the report to the conversation.

### Step 6 -- Performance Validation (Coverage Mode)

- Verify skill completed within the NFR-040 constraint of under 60 seconds.
- Log total execution time in the report footer.
- If gaps were found, emit completion nudge: "Run `/gaia-fill-test-gaps` to remediate these gaps now."

### Step 7 -- Scan Generated Test Cases (Verification Mode)

- Scan `docs/test-artifacts/` for all generated test case files matching `{story_key}-*.md` and ATDD files `atdd-{story_key}*.md`.
- Build a map of generated test cases per story: `story_key -> [test_case_id, test_file, test_name]`.
- Count total generated test cases per story (`generated` count) and in aggregate (`total_generated`).

### Step 8 -- Detect and Parse Execution Results (Verification Mode)

- Scan for test execution result files in the following formats:
  1. JUnit XML -- parse test name, status from XML testcase elements
  2. LCOV coverage files -- parse source file coverage data
  3. E17 evidence JSON -- parse test IDs and execution status per E17-S10 schema
- If no execution result files found: log warning "No test execution results found -- falling back to coverage mode output" and proceed to Step 5 instead.
- Build a unified executed tests map: `test_id -> {status, source_format, last_run}`.

### Step 9 -- Cross-Reference Generated vs Executed (Verification Mode)

- For each story, cross-reference generated test cases against the executed tests map.
- Classify each test case as: EXECUTED (found in results) or UNEXECUTED (not found).
- Calculate per-story `exec_ratio = (executed / generated) * 100`, rounded to one decimal place.
- Division-by-zero: when `generated == 0`, set `exec_ratio = 0.0%` with note `(0/0 -- no generated tests)`.
- Flag stories with `executed == 0` and `generated > 0` as HIGH priority gaps.

### Step 10 -- Generate Verification Output (FR-226 Schema)

- Generate verification mode report with:
  - **Executive Summary** with aggregate `Generated vs Executed: {total_executed}/{total_generated} ({aggregate_exec_ratio}%)`
  - **Per-Story Detail** with `generated`, `executed`, and `exec_ratio` fields
  - **Unverified Tests Table** listing test files with UNVERIFIED status
  - HIGH priority flags for stories with zero executed tests
- Print the report to the conversation.

### Step 11 -- Performance Validation (Verification Mode)

- Verify skill completed within the NFR-040 constraint of under 60 seconds.
- Log total execution time in the report footer.
- If gaps were found, emit completion nudge: "Run `/gaia-fill-test-gaps` to remediate these gaps now."
