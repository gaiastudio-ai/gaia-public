# verify-pr-merged.sh — post-completion gate for gaia-dev-story (E20-S19)
#
# Verifies that a merge commit containing the story key exists on the target
# branch. Called by the orchestrator after the dev-story subagent returns
# status=done, before accepting the done transition.
#
# Covers both squash-merge and merge-commit strategies by searching the full
# git log (not just --merges) with a word-boundary pattern.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-pr-merged.sh <story_key> <target_branch>
#   verify-pr-merged.sh <story_key> --no-chain
#
# Environment:
#   PROJECT_PATH — optional. The git working directory (defaults to .).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — merge commit found on target branch (gate passes)
#   1 — usage/argument error
#   2 — no merge commit found (gate fails; orchestrator should re-run Steps 10-13)
#   3 — no promotion chain configured (gate skips silently)
