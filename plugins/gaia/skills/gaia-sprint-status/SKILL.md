## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-sprint-status/scripts/setup.sh

## Mission

Display the current sprint status by invoking the deterministic `sprint-status-dashboard.sh` formatter script. This skill is read-only with respect to `sprint-status.yaml` — it NEVER writes to or modifies the sprint status file under any code path, per CLAUDE.md Sprint-Status Write Safety.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/lifecycle/workflows/4-implementation/sprint-status/` XML engine workflow (brief Cluster 8, story E28-S61). Nearly all work is delegated to the bash formatter script per ADR-042 (scripts-over-LLM).

## Critical Rules

- This skill is strictly read-only with respect to story files — NEVER modifies frontmatter or body content.
- The skill MAY write to `sprint-status.yaml` but only indirectly through the `sprint-state.sh reconcile` call in Step 2. Reconcile is the single authorized writer, and its edits are always derivative corrections pulled from authoritative story-file frontmatter per ADR-055 §10.29.1 and NFR-SPQG-2.
- All dashboard rendering is performed by `sprint-status-dashboard.sh` — do NOT implement formatting logic in the LLM layer.
- If the formatter script exits non-zero, surface the error message to the user and stop. Do NOT attempt to render the dashboard manually.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Run Dashboard Formatter

Run the sprint-status-dashboard.sh formatter script:

```bash
PROJECT_PATH="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT}" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/sprint-status-dashboard.sh"
```

If the script exits 0, present its stdout output to the user verbatim — do not reformat, filter, or enhance the dashboard output. The script produces the canonical dashboard rendering. When the current sprint contains at least one story with `risk: HIGH` in its story-file frontmatter, the dashboard appends a "Recommended mitigations for HIGH-risk stories" block listing every entry from the bundled mitigation catalog per FR-SPQG-5.

If the script exits non-zero, display the error output and inform the user:
- Exit 1 with "not found": `sprint-status.yaml` does not exist. Suggest running `/gaia-sprint-plan` first.
- Exit 1 with "malformed": the YAML file is corrupt. Suggest running `/gaia-sprint-status` after fixing the file.

### Step 2 — Reconcile Sprint Status (Post-Dashboard)

After the dashboard renders successfully, invoke `sprint-state.sh reconcile` to detect and auto-correct drift between authoritative story-file frontmatter and the derivative `sprint-status.yaml` cache per ADR-055 §10.29.1.

```bash
PROJECT_PATH="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT}" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/sprint-state.sh" reconcile
```

Invocation order rationale: reconcile runs AFTER the dashboard so the user always sees the current (possibly drifted) view first, then receives an auditable summary of any corrections applied. This ordering makes drift visible rather than silently masked.

Surface the reconcile output verbatim to the user — do NOT swallow errors or filter the per-story `RECONCILE:` lines and the trailing `RECONCILE SUMMARY:` line. Exit-code handling:

- Exit 0: either no drift was detected (ideal steady state) or drift was auto-corrected. Mention the summary line to the user so they know which stories were updated.
- Exit 1: reconcile encountered an error (missing story file, malformed frontmatter, write failure, read-only yaml). Do NOT suppress this — surface the error so the user can investigate. The dashboard has already rendered, so the workflow can complete even if reconcile surfaces an error.
- Exit 2: only returned when reconcile is invoked with `--dry-run` (this skill never uses dry-run). If seen, treat as a bug.

Feature-flag escape hatch: a future rollout toggle may gate this call. If `GAIA_DISABLE_RECONCILE=1` is set in the environment, skip Step 2 entirely so a frontmatter-parse regression can be isolated without reverting the wiring.

### Step 3 — Suggest Next Actions

Based on the dashboard output, suggest relevant next actions:

- If stories are in `ready-for-dev`: suggest `/gaia-dev-story {story_key}` for the highest-priority story.
- If stories are in `review`: suggest `/gaia-run-all-reviews {story_key}` for stories awaiting review.
- If stories are `blocked`: note the blocking dependency.
- If all stories are `done`: suggest `/gaia-retro` for a sprint retrospective.
