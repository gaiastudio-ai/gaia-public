## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-infra-design/scripts/setup.sh

## Memory

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/memory-loader.sh devops decision-log

## Mission

You are orchestrating the creation of an Infrastructure Design document. The infrastructure authoring is delegated to the **devops** subagent (Soren), who designs deployment topology, environment layout, IaC structure, and observability plans. You load the architecture document, validate inputs, coordinate the multi-step flow, and write the output to `docs/planning-artifacts/infrastructure-design.md`.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/lifecycle/workflows/3-solutioning/infrastructure-design` workflow (brief Cluster 6, story P6-S5 / E28-S49). The step ordering, prompts, and output path are preserved verbatim from the legacy `instructions.xml` — do not restructure, re-prompt, or reorder.

## Critical Rules

- An architecture document MUST exist at `docs/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` before starting. If missing, fail fast with "Architecture doc not found at docs/planning-artifacts/architecture.md — run /gaia-create-arch first."
- Every significant infrastructure decision must be recorded in the devops-sidecar memory.
- Every environment must have a defined purpose and access policy.
- Infrastructure authoring is delegated to the `devops` subagent (Soren) via native Claude Code subagent invocation — do NOT inline Soren's persona into this skill body. If the devops subagent (E28-S21) is not available, fail with "devops subagent not available — install E28-S21" error.
- If `docs/planning-artifacts/infrastructure-design.md` already exists, warn the user: "An existing infrastructure design document was found. Continuing will overwrite it. Confirm to proceed or abort." Do not silently overwrite.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Load Architecture

- Read `docs/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`.
- Extract component inventory, service boundaries, data stores.
- Identify compute, storage, and networking requirements.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-infra-design 1 project_name="$PROJECT_NAME" target_environments="$TARGET_ENVIRONMENTS" iac_stack="$IAC_STACK" topology_version="$TOPOLOGY_VERSION"`

### Step 2 — Environment Design

Delegate to the **devops** subagent (Soren) via `agents/devops` to design environments.

- Define environments: dev, staging, production (+ preview if needed).
- Specify environment parity strategy — how close staging mirrors production.
- Define access policies and promotion gates between environments.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-infra-design 2 project_name="$PROJECT_NAME" target_environments="$TARGET_ENVIRONMENTS" iac_stack="$IAC_STACK" stage=environments`

### Step 3 — Deployment Topology

Delegate to the **devops** subagent (Soren) via `agents/devops` to design the deployment topology.

- Define container orchestration strategy (Kubernetes, ECS, serverless, etc.).
- Design service mesh and load balancing approach.
- Specify scaling strategy: horizontal, vertical, auto-scaling triggers.
- Define networking: VPC, subnets, security groups, CDN.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-infra-design 3 project_name="$PROJECT_NAME" target_environments="$TARGET_ENVIRONMENTS" iac_stack="$IAC_STACK" stage=topology`

### Step 4 — IaC Structure

Delegate to the **devops** subagent (Soren) via `agents/devops` to define infrastructure-as-code.

- Define Infrastructure-as-Code project structure and module design.
- Specify IaC tool and conventions (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation).
- Design module boundaries matching service boundaries.
- Define state management strategy.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-infra-design 4 project_name="$PROJECT_NAME" target_environments="$TARGET_ENVIRONMENTS" iac_stack="$IAC_STACK" stage=iac`

### Step 5 — Observability Plan

Delegate to the **devops** subagent (Soren) via `agents/devops` to define observability.

- Define logging strategy: structured logs, log aggregation, retention.
- Define metrics: application metrics, infrastructure metrics, custom dashboards.
- Define tracing: distributed tracing, correlation IDs.
- Define alerting: SLO-based alerts, escalation policies, on-call rotation.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-infra-design 5 project_name="$PROJECT_NAME" target_environments="$TARGET_ENVIRONMENTS" iac_stack="$IAC_STACK" stage=observability`

### Step 6 — Generate Output

- Record key decisions in devops-sidecar memory.
- Write the infrastructure design document to `docs/planning-artifacts/infrastructure-design.md` with: environment matrix, deployment topology, IaC structure, observability plan, and decision rationale.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-infra-design 6 project_name="$PROJECT_NAME" target_environments="$TARGET_ENVIRONMENTS" iac_stack="$IAC_STACK" stage=output --paths docs/planning-artifacts/infrastructure-design.md`

## Validation

<!--
  E42-S12 — V1→V2 25-item checklist port (FR-341, FR-359, VCP-CHK-23, VCP-CHK-24).
  Classification (25 items total):
    - Script-verifiable: 15 (SV-01..SV-15) — enforced by finalize.sh.
    - LLM-checkable:     10 (LLM-01..LLM-10) — evaluated by the host LLM
      against the infrastructure-design.md artifact at finalize time.
  Exit code 0 when all 15 script-verifiable items PASS; non-zero otherwise.

  The V1 source checklist at
  _gaia/lifecycle/workflows/3-solutioning/infrastructure-design/checklist.md
  ships 13 explicit bullets across five V1 categories (Environments,
  Deployment, IaC, Observability, Output Verification). The story 25-item
  count is authoritative per docs/v1-v2-command-gap-analysis.md §11; the
  remaining 12 items are reconciled from V1 instructions.xml step outputs
  (story Task 1.3):
    - per-environment access policy and promotion gates
    - dev / staging / production triad declared
    - auto-scaling triggers and networking detail (VPC/subnets/CDN)
    - IaC tool named with rationale, module-to-service-boundary alignment
    - state management strategy
    - distributed tracing / correlation IDs
    - alerting, escalation, and on-call specifics
    - structural shape requirements of the output file (non-empty,
      output path correct, section headings present)
    - sidecar decision write reference.

  V1 category coverage mapping (25 items):
    Environments         — SV-03, SV-04, SV-05, LLM-01, LLM-02           (5)
    Deployment           — SV-06, SV-07, SV-08, LLM-03, LLM-04           (5)
    IaC                  — SV-09, SV-10, SV-11, LLM-05, LLM-10           (5)
    Observability        — SV-12, SV-13, SV-14, LLM-06, LLM-07, LLM-08   (6)
    Output Verification  — SV-01, SV-02, SV-15, LLM-09                   (4)
    Total                                                                 25

  The VCP-CHK-24 anchor is SV-11 — "State management strategy specified".
  This is the V1 phrase verbatim and MUST appear in violation output
  when the state-management item fails (story AC2).

  Invoked by `finalize.sh` at post-complete (per §10.31.1). Validation
  runs BEFORE the checkpoint and lifecycle-event writes (observability
  is never suppressed by checklist outcome — story AC5).

  See docs/implementation-artifacts/E42-S12-port-gaia-infra-design-25-item-checklist-to-v2.md.
