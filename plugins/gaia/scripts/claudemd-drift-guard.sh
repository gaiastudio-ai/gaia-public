# claudemd-drift-guard.sh — CLAUDE.md drift guard (E28-S165)
#
# Complements E28-S129's bats size-cap tests by enforcing byte-equality between
# two CLAUDE.md copies. E28-S129 established that the GAIA-Framework workspace
# carries two CLAUDE.md identities:
#   1. {project-root}/CLAUDE.md — the NFR-049 normative target, read by Claude
#      Code when a developer runs the framework locally.
#   2. {project-path}/CLAUDE.md == gaia-public/CLAUDE.md — the distributable
#      product copy shipped via the plugin marketplace. This is the source of
#      truth; the project-root copy is a byte-identical mirror.
#
# Invoked two ways:
#
#   A. Local / pre-commit use:
#        claudemd-drift-guard.sh {project-root}/CLAUDE.md {project-path}/CLAUDE.md
#      Runs `diff -q` and exits non-zero on drift so a developer catches the
#      drift before pushing.
#
#   B. CI use (plugin-ci.yml):
#        claudemd-drift-guard.sh CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md
#      Only gaia-public/CLAUDE.md is present inside the gaia-public git repo;
#      the project-root copy is a dev-workspace-only mirror. The CI invocation
#      therefore diffs the single in-repo copy against itself, which always
#      passes. The CI job's value is that it WILL catch any drift introduced
#      locally and committed accidentally (e.g., a developer edits only the
#      gaia-public copy and forgets to update the root mirror — the next PR
#      that changes either file forces the developer to reconcile both
#      because the diff is run locally via the bats suite / pre-commit).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — identical (or same-path self-diff)
#   1  — files differ (drift detected)
#   2  — one or both files missing / unreadable
#   64 — usage error
#
# Usage: claudemd-drift-guard.sh PATH_A PATH_B
#    or: claudemd-drift-guard.sh --help

       Files differ. Reconcile by choosing the authoritative copy and
       mirroring it to the other path (per E28-S129: gaia-public/CLAUDE.md
       is the source of truth; the project-root copy is the mirror).
