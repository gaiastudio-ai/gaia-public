# adapters/brownfield/reconcile.sh — Phase 4b reconciliation pass.
#
# A PURE JSON-join (no tool re-invocation): reads the deduped finding
# stream + per-stack call-graph outputs, builds an entry-point reachable-set, and
# DEMOTES Phase 3 file-only findings to severity INFO when the file is reachable
# from >=1 application entry point — the barrel-file / dynamic-import false-positive
# guard. The architectural lynchpin keeping FP rates tolerable for the
# deterministic-tools rollout.
#
# DEMOTE, NOT REMOVE (audit-trail integrity): a demoted finding keeps every identity
# field and gains annotations:
#   severity: "info"  (was warning|error)
#   reconciled: true
#   original_severity: "<prior>"
#   entry_points: [...]
#   reconciliation_reason: "file referenced from <N> call-graph entries"
# Identity fields (file_path, qualifier, source_tool, ruleId, start_line) are
# preserved VERBATIM. Files NOT reachable retain their original severity.
#
# Single-level reachability suffices: the call-graph outputs already encode
# transitivity, so one membership test per finding against the precomputed
# reachable-set is enough — no recursive walk, no tool re-invocation. <5s on a
# 1M-line monorepo.
#
# Producer-path contract: the per-stack call-graph outputs
# `callgraph-{js,go,python}.json` are the canonical reconciliation input.
# Cross-stack analysis is a SIBLING consumer of dependency-graph data
# (`depgraph.json`); both degrade independently when their input is absent. The
# call-graph producer is Phase 4's responsibility.
#
# Empty/missing call-graph -> WARN + passthrough unchanged
# (findings_demoted_by_reconciliation:0). NEVER aborts. Pure bash + jq; offline.
#
# Env seams (tests/phase-4b-reconciliation.bats):
#   RECON_FINDINGS      deduped-findings.json (dedup pass output)
#   RECON_CALLGRAPH_DIR dir holding callgraph-{js,go,python}.json
