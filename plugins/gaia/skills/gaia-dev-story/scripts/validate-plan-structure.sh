# validate-plan-structure.sh — gaia-dev-story Step 4 plan-structure gate (E55-S5)
#
# Purpose:
#   Reject any /gaia-dev-story Step 4 plan that is missing a required
#   section. The canonical 9-section list is sourced from FR-DSH-4
#   (docs/planning-artifacts/prd/prd.md §4.36) and ADR-073
#   (docs/planning-artifacts/architecture/architecture.md Decision Log).
#
# Canonical sections (top-to-bottom; first miss wins):
#   1. Context
#   2. Root Cause            (REWORK only — gated on --rework flag)
#   3. Implementation Steps
#   4. Files to Modify
#   5. Architecture Refs
#   6. UX Refs
#   7. Testing Strategy
#   8. Risks
#   9. Verification Plan
#
# T-38 mitigation:
#   The threat is Unicode-homoglyph spoofing of section headers (e.g.,
#   Cyrillic `С` U+0421 vs ASCII `C` U+0043). We use `grep -F` with literal
#   ASCII strings — Cyrillic `Сontext` will NOT match `Context`. No regex
#   anchors, no Unicode normalization.
#
# Usage:
#   validate-plan-structure.sh [--rework] [<plan-file>]
#
#   With no plan-file argument the validator reads the plan from stdin.
#   The --rework flag enables the `Root Cause` section requirement; without
#   it, REWORK-only sections are skipped (new-feature plans are exempt).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — all required sections present
#   1 — at least one required section missing (first miss reported on stderr)
#   2 — usage error (e.g., bad flag)
