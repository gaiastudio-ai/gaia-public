# commands-guard.sh — GAIA foundation script (E28-S127)
#
# FR-329 regression guard. Fails the build if any gaia-*.md file reappears
# under gaia-public/plugins/gaia/commands/. The commands/ surface was retired
# as part of Cluster 18 (Cleanup & Migration) and MUST NOT be repopulated —
# skills under plugins/gaia/skills/ are the sole user-invocation surface.
#
# Refs: FR-329, NFR-050, ADR-048
# Story: E28-S127 Task 6 / AC5
#
# This is a NARROW-SCOPE guard: directory-emptiness check only. Broader
# active-code scanning for legacy file-path references is handled by
# dead-reference-scan.sh (same directory).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — clean (commands/ absent OR present with no gaia-*.md files)
#   1 — regression detected (one or more gaia-*.md files found)
#   64 — usage error
#
# Usage: commands-guard.sh --project-root PATH
