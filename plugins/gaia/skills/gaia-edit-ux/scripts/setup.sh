# setup.sh — Cluster 5 planning skill setup (E28-S43, brief §Cluster 5 / P5-S4)
#
# Mechanical extension of the Cluster 4 reference implementation authored
# under E28-S35 (gaia-brainstorm/scripts/setup.sh). Adds edit-ux-specific
# prereq gates:
#   - ux-design.md must exist in planning-artifacts (validate-gate file_exists)
#
# Responsibilities (per brief §Cluster 4):
#   1. Resolve config via the shared resolve-config.sh foundation script
#   2. Run validate-gate.sh for prereqs (ux-design.md existence)
#   3. Load the checkpoint state for this workflow
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — setup succeeded, skill body can run
#   1 — config resolution, gate validation, or checkpoint load failed
#
# POSIX discipline: bash with [[ ]] and indexed arrays only. LC_ALL=C for
# deterministic output. macOS /bin/bash 3.2 compatible.
