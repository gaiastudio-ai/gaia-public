# Regression coverage for AF-2026-05-21-16: /gaia-meeting hardcoded legacy
# docs/creative-artifacts/ paths (primary write target: meeting-{date}-{slug}.md)
# and docs/planning-artifacts/action-items.yaml (CROSS-FAMILY relocation to
# .gaia/state/action-items.yaml). Approach: canonical-unconditional
# (no three-tier idiom) because write-boundary.sh post-E96-S8 enforces
# canonical-only — legacy docs/ prefix is REJECTED at runtime.
