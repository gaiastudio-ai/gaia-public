# review-gate.sh — GAIA foundation script
#
# Parses and atomically updates the `## Review Gate` table in a story markdown
# file. Consumed by the six review workflows (code-review, qa-tests,
# security-review, test-automate, test-review, review-perf) and their
# aggregator (run-all-reviews), which previously rewrote the table via LLM
# edits — one engine token-burn path.
#
# Invocation contract (stable for bats-core authors):
#
#   review-gate.sh check             --story <key>
#   review-gate.sh update            --story <key> --gate <name> --verdict <PASSED|FAILED|UNVERIFIED> [--plan-id <id>]
#   review-gate.sh status            --story <key> [--gate <name> --plan-id <id>]
#   review-gate.sh review-gate-check --story <key>
#   review-gate.sh --help
#
# Canonical gate names (case-sensitive, exact):
#   "Code Review" | "QA Tests" | "Security Review"
#   "Test Automation" | "Test Review" | "Performance Review"
#
# Fork-context read-only allowlist:
#   The `review-gate-check` sub-operation is a pure read and is safe to
#   invoke from a subagent whose tool allowlist is `Read`, `Grep`, `Bash`
#   only (no `Write`, no `Edit`). It never modifies the story file,
#   creates tempfiles / lockfiles / sidecar scratch files, or touches
#   sprint-status.yaml.
#
# Extended gate name (requires --plan-id):
#   "test-automate-plan" — ledger-only gate for approval-gate verdict keying
#
# Canonical verdict vocabulary (case-sensitive, exact — per CLAUDE.md):
#   UNVERIFIED | PASSED | FAILED
#
# Any deviation (case, typo, shell metacharacters, extra whitespace in the
# --verdict value) exits 1 with a clear stderr message. The script never maps
# keywords — callers (e.g. code-review mapping APPROVE→PASSED) are responsible
# for the translation.
#
# Config:
#   PROJECT_PATH — optional. Defaults to "." when unset. If resolve-config.sh
#     becomes available on PATH later, callers may pre-export PROJECT_PATH from
#     it; review-gate.sh does NOT source resolve-config.sh directly so the two
#     foundation scripts can land in any order (soft dependency per story
#     notes / Task 1 Subtask 1.3).
#   IMPLEMENTATION_ARTIFACTS — optional. Defaults to
#     "${PROJECT_PATH}/.gaia/artifacts/implementation-artifacts" when unset. Same env var
#     convention as sprint-state.sh.
#
# Story file location (flat layout):
#   ${IMPLEMENTATION_ARTIFACTS}/<key>-*.md
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — success (check: all PASSED; update: row rewritten; status: JSON emitted;
#       --help)
#   1 — usage error, unknown subcommand, invalid verdict or gate name, story
#       glob zero-match / multi-match, missing `## Review Gate` section, fewer
#       than six canonical rows, concurrency timeout, rewrite failure, or
#       (check) any row not PASSED
#
# Atomicity & concurrency:
#   Writes go to a tempfile next to the story file (same filesystem so `mv`
#   is atomic POSIX rename), then `mv` over the original inside a `flock -x`
#   on a sibling `.lock`. On systems without util-linux `flock(1)` (macOS
#   /bin/bash 3.2 without Homebrew util-linux), the script degrades to a
#   bounded spin-loop mv-based advisory lockfile — same fallback as
#   checkpoint.sh and lifecycle-event.sh.
#
# POSIX discipline: the only non-POSIX constructs are [[ ]] and bash indexed
# arrays. macOS /bin/bash 3.2 compatible. Uses `awk` (POSIX), `jq` (required
# for `status`), and `flock` (optional — graceful fallback).
#
# Sprint-Status Write Safety (CRITICAL, per CLAUDE.md):
#   This script NEVER writes to sprint-status.yaml. The Review Gate table
#   lives only in the story file. sprint-status.yaml is a derived view and
#   is reconciled by /gaia-sprint-status — never by review workflows.

Usage:
  review-gate.sh check             --story <key>
  review-gate.sh update            --story <key> --gate <name> --verdict <PASSED|FAILED|UNVERIFIED> [--plan-id <id>]
  review-gate.sh status            --story <key> [--gate <name> --plan-id <id>]
  review-gate.sh review-gate-check --story <key>
  review-gate.sh --help

Subcommands:
  check             Exit 0 iff all six Review Gate rows are PASSED. Otherwise
                    exit 1 and list the non-PASSED gate names on stderr (one
                    per line).
  update            Atomically rewrite exactly one row of the Review Gate
                    table. Only the Status and Report cells of the matched
                    gate are changed — all other bytes of the story file are
                    preserved (headers, blank lines, other rows, trailing
                    content). Writes are serialized via flock. When --plan-id
                    is provided, the verdict is written to the ledger file
                    instead (tab-separated: story_key gate plan_id verdict).
  status            Print a single JSON object to stdout via jq -nc. Without
                    --plan-id, returns the full Review Gate table. With
                    --gate and --plan-id, queries the ledger for the
                    (story_key, gate, plan_id) tuple.
  review-gate-check Composite Review Gate check. Reads the six Review Gate
                    rows and prints the table followed by a summary line:
                      Review Gate: COMPLETE   (exit 0) — all six PASSED
                      Review Gate: BLOCKED    (exit 1) — any FAILED
                                              (FAILED dominates over PENDING)
                      Review Gate: PENDING    (exit 2) — any UNVERIFIED or
                                              NOT STARTED and no FAILED
                    On BLOCKED, a "Blocking gates:" list names each FAILED
                    row. On PENDING, a "Pending gates:" list names each
                    UNVERIFIED / NOT STARTED row. On COMPLETE no list is
                    emitted. Stderr is empty on all three success paths.
                    Read-only: zero file writes, zero lockfile or tempfile
                    creation. Safe to invoke under a subagent read-only
                    allowlist of Read, Grep, Bash.

Flags:
  --story <key>      Story key (required for all subcommands).
  --gate <name>      Gate name (required for update; optional for status).
  --verdict <V>      Verdict value (required for update).
  --plan-id <id>     Plan identifier for ledger-keyed verdicts.
                     Must match [A-Za-z0-9._:+-]+. Required for the
                     "test-automate-plan" gate; optional for canonical gates.
  --ledger <path>    Override ledger file path (default: $PROJECT_PATH/.review-gate-ledger
                     or $REVIEW_GATE_LEDGER env var).
  --report <path>    Proof-of-execution: path to the per-review report file
                     written by the dispatched skill. Required for PASSED /
                     FAILED verdicts (refused if file does not exist). Not
                     required for UNVERIFIED (seed).
  --execution-evidence <path>
                     Proof-of-execution: path to execution-evidence.json.
                     Required (in addition to --report) for test-execution
                     gates: "QA Tests", "Test Automation", "Test Review".
  --report-missing-reason <reason>
                     Explicit escape hatch when no report exists (e.g. FAILED
                     verdict with no salvageable report). Suppresses the
                     --report / --execution-evidence checks and records the
                     reason in the audit log.

  Proof-of-execution can be disabled via REVIEW_GATE_PROOF_OF_EXECUTION=off
  for bats fixtures that exercise verdict mechanics without dispatching real
  review skills.

Canonical gate names (case-sensitive):
  "Code Review" | "QA Tests" | "Security Review"
  "Test Automation" | "Test Review" | "Performance Review"

Extended gate names (require --plan-id):
  "test-automate-plan"

Canonical verdicts (case-sensitive, per CLAUDE.md):
  UNVERIFIED | PASSED | FAILED

Story file is located via the glob
  ${IMPLEMENTATION_ARTIFACTS}/<key>-*.md
IMPLEMENTATION_ARTIFACTS defaults to "${PROJECT_PATH}/docs/implementation-artifacts".
PROJECT_PATH defaults to "." when unset.

Exit codes:
  0 — success (check: all PASSED; review-gate-check: COMPLETE)
  1 — usage error, invalid input, missing file/section, (check) any non-PASSED
      row, or (review-gate-check) BLOCKED — any FAILED row
  2 — (review-gate-check) PENDING — any UNVERIFIED / NOT STARTED row and no
      FAILED. Distinct from the exit-1 error path so callers can distinguish
      "still in progress" from "explicitly failed".

# ---------- Review Gate table parser ----------

#      ends (blank line, new header, or EOF).

# Unknown gate names are preserved in the file (spurious rows are left

# Composite Review Gate check. Emits the six-row Review Gate table verbatim
# followed by a summary line and — on the BLOCKED or PENDING paths — a list
# of the offending gate names. Exit codes are deterministic:
#
#   0 — COMPLETE: all six gates have verdict PASSED
#   1 — BLOCKED:  at least one gate is FAILED (FAILED dominates PENDING)
#   2 — PENDING:  at least one gate is UNVERIFIED / NOT STARTED and
#                 no gate is FAILED
#
# Read-only: zero file writes, zero tempfile / mv / flock. The sub-operation
# only parses the story file — it never creates, modifies, or deletes any
# file or sidecar. Before/after shasum -a 256 of the story file is
# byte-identical across all three verdict paths.
#
# Fork-context: safe to invoke under a subagent whose tool allowlist is
# Read, Grep, Bash only — the execution path uses awk / grep / bash
# built-ins and the existing locate_story_file helper.

# Classify the six canonical verdicts into a composite status. Used as a
# standalone helper so callers and unit tests can exercise the decision
# logic independently of I/O. Echoes exactly one of: COMPLETE | BLOCKED |
