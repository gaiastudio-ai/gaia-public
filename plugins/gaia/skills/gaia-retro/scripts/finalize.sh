  # checkpoint, as a proxy for "Step 7 (Val sidecar write) actually ran this
  # invocation". It is intentionally lightweight but NOT tamper-proof: any
  # unrelated process that touches decision-log.md refreshes its mtime and can
  # satisfy this check without a real Val write; conversely a fast re-finalize
  # can race the mtime granularity. A robust replacement is an explicit
  # (workflow, run_id) -> decision_id ledger keyed to THIS run, rather than a
  # filesystem-mtime comparison — tracked as a future hardening (do not rely on
  # this guard for adversarial tamper-resistance; it is a sequencing sanity
  # check, not a security control). The same caveat applies to the sibling
  # gaia-triage-findings finalize.sh guard.
