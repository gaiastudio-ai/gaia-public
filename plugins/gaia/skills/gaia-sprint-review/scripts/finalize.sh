# finalize.sh — /gaia-sprint-review skill finalize
#
# Mechanical mirror of /gaia-add-feature/scripts/finalize.sh — same
# sentinel-guard precondition + checkpoint write + lifecycle emit pattern.
#
# Responsibilities:
#   1. Validate the Val dispatch sentinel exists when SPRINT_ID is
#      exported (set by the orchestrator at SKILL.md Step 3). The sentinel
#      path is `_memory/checkpoints/sprint-review-${SPRINT_ID}-val-
#      dispatched.json`. A missing or malformed sentinel HALTs with the
#      canonical error string.
#   2. Write the workflow completion checkpoint.
#   3. Emit the lifecycle event.
#
# Sentinel guard is OPTIONAL — when SPRINT_ID is unset (e.g., the skill
# bailed out at Step 1 pre-condition gate before any Val dispatch), the
# guard is a no-op. Production cascades MUST always export SPRINT_ID
# before invoking finalize.sh; legacy fixtures and short-circuit paths
# may skip.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — finalize succeeded.
#   1 — sentinel guard tripped (missing/malformed sentinel) OR checkpoint
#       write failed.
#
# POSIX discipline: bash with [[ ]] only. macOS /bin/bash 3.2 compatible.
