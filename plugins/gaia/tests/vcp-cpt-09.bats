# vcp-cpt-09.bats — shared-helper exclusivity for Phase 1 skills (E43-S2).
#
# NFR-VCP-1 mandate: every checkpoint write MUST route through
# scripts/write-checkpoint.sh. No SKILL.md and no co-located script under
# the 6 Phase 1 skill directories may write JSON directly into
# _memory/checkpoints/ via printf/echo/cat/tee/redirect.
#
# VCP-CPT-09 is the regression guard that enforces NFR-VCP-1 on a per-PR
# basis — any future change that re-introduces inline checkpoint-writing
# logic trips the assertions below.
