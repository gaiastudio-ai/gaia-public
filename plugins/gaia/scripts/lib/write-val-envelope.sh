# write-val-envelope.sh — orchestrator-side Val envelope sentinel writer.
#
# Background:
#   This helper shifts the sentinel write to the orchestrator's main turn.
#   Val now RETURNS the sentinel content as a `sentinel_envelope` field
#   inside its envelope; the orchestrator parses the envelope and invokes
#   this helper to write the sentinel.
#
# Forgery resistance:
#   The `persona_sig` field is computed by Val from validator.md's on-disk
#   sha256 — the orchestrator cannot fabricate a valid sig without reading
#   validator.md at the same revision. The orchestrator is a write-through,
#   not a source of trust.
#
# Contract:
#   write-val-envelope.sh --envelope <json>          # JSON literal as arg
#   write-val-envelope.sh --envelope-stdin           # JSON read from stdin
#
#   The writer accepts Val's RETURNED envelope shape DIRECTLY — the caller
#   does NOT reshape the payload. Two shapes are tolerated:
#     - NESTED: the returned envelope wraps the canonical sentinel under a
#       `sentinel_envelope` object key (alongside outer status/findings). The
#       writer unwraps that inner object and writes it verbatim — persona_sig
#       is passed through, never recomputed caller-side.
#     - FLAT: the canonical sentinel fields are already at the top level. The
#       writer accepts the payload as-is.
#   Both shapes produce a sentinel that passes assert-agent-envelope.sh; shape
#   tolerance is an input-shaping concern in this writer only — the asserter's
#   required-field set is NOT extended.
#
#   The (unwrapped) sentinel JSON must contain ALL FIVE required keys:
#     agent          — MUST equal the literal string "val"
#     persona_sig    — non-empty string (forgery-resistance anchor)
#     timestamp      — ISO-8601 UTC timestamp (string)
#     artifact_path  — string; used to compute sentinel path
#     verdict        — one of PASSED|FAILED|UNVERIFIED
#
#   OPTIONAL keys (additive — NOT required):
#     original_status — pre-coercion OUTER envelope status (∈ {PASS,WARNING,
#                       CRITICAL}); present only when a downstream closed-enum
#                       reduction coerced the outer status. The writer is
#                       additive-transparent: it serializes the whole input
#                       envelope verbatim, so any optional field present in the
#                       input is preserved on disk pass-through. It MUST NOT be
#                       added to the required-key loop. Absent original_status
#                       => sentinel byte-identical to today's output.
#
#   The sentinel path is computed as
#     ${CHECKPOINT_PATH}/val-envelope-${HASH}.json
#   where HASH is the first 16 hex characters of sha256(artifact_path).
#
#   CHECKPOINT_PATH defaults to ".gaia/memory/checkpoints" (resolved
#   relative to the resolver-discovered project_root, or to $PWD when the
#   resolver helper is absent). The legacy `_memory/checkpoints` path was
#   retired with the consolidation migration. Tests may override via the
#   CHECKPOINT_PATH env var.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — sentinel written; path printed to stdout
#   1 — malformed JSON, missing required field, wrong agent value, write
#       failure
#   2 — usage error (no envelope provided)
#
# Atomic write idiom: sibling tempfile + mv (POSIX-atomic on the same
# filesystem). No partial sentinel ever lands on disk.
#
# POSIX discipline: bash with [[ ]] only. macOS /bin/bash 3.2 compatible.

Usage:
  write-val-envelope.sh --envelope <json>
  write-val-envelope.sh --envelope-stdin

The envelope JSON MUST contain all five keys:
  agent (== "val"), persona_sig, timestamp, artifact_path, verdict.

CHECKPOINT_PATH env var sets the checkpoint directory (default:
.gaia/memory/checkpoints relative to the resolved project_root).

# Val RETURNS its sentinel content; the orchestrator passes that returned
# envelope to this writer VERBATIM — no caller-side reshaping. Two shapes are
# tolerated, both producing a sentinel that passes assert-agent-envelope.sh:
#
#   1. NESTED — the returned envelope wraps the canonical sentinel under a
#      `sentinel_envelope` object key (alongside outer status/findings/summary).
#      The writer UNWRAPS that inner object and uses it VERBATIM as the
#      sentinel. persona_sig is passed through exactly as returned — never
#      recomputed or re-injected caller-side. Outer wrapper keys are dropped.
#
#   2. FLAT — the returned envelope already carries the canonical sentinel
#      fields (agent, persona_sig, timestamp, artifact_path, verdict) at the
#      top level. The writer accepts it as-is.
#
# Shape detection is on the WRITER's input only; the asserter's required-field
# set is unchanged. When `sentinel_envelope` is present AND is a JSON object,
# we replace ENVELOPE with that inner object and the rest of the writer runs
# unchanged (required-key loop, persona_sig check, artifact_path normalization,
# atomic write). A `sentinel_envelope` that is null or a non-object is ignored
# (treated as the flat shape) so a stray scalar never breaks a flat payload.
