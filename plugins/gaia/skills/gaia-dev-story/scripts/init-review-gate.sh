# init-review-gate.sh — gaia-dev-story Step 15 Review Gate seeder (E55-S8)
#
# Purpose:
#   Insert (or replace) the Review Gate table block in a story file with
#   the canonical 6-row UNVERIFIED block. Idempotent — running twice
#   yields the same final file (byte-identical).
#
# Behavior:
#   - Locate the `## Review Gate` heading in the story file.
#   - If present: delete from that heading down to (but not including) the
#                 next H2 heading or EOF, then insert the canonical block in
#                 place.
#   - If absent: append the canonical block at end-of-file.
#
# Canonical block:
#   ## Review Gate
