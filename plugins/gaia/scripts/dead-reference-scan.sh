#
# Scans the project tree for references to legacy-engine paths that were retired

# allowlist (docs, CHANGELOG, migration guide, parity-guard bats, E28-S126
# tooling itself, and explicit per-file allowlist entries for passive/historical
# prose references).

# Refs: FR-328, NFR-050, ADR-048 (program-closing CI compensating control)
# Story: E28-S126 Task 3 / AC6 / AC-EC7
#
# Used by .github/workflows/adr-048-guard.yml as the required PR check.

# Exit codes:
#   0 — clean (no active-code references)

# Patterns that identify references to retired artifacts. Three families covered:
#   (1) ADR-048 engine/protocols/manifests (E28-S126 scope)
#   (2) FR-329 slash-command file-path references — anchored on .md extension so
#       the invocation form "/gaia-foo" (used freely in skill prose) does NOT match.
#   (3) E28-S128 workflow-artifact filenames — word-boundary match catches backtick-
#       prose, parenthesized, colon-prefixed, and path-form references. Shell-variable
#       forms (e.g., "$workflow.yaml" in checkpoint.sh) are stripped by the
#       is_shell_variable_context() negative-filter below.
#
# The slash-command patterns are deliberately written against file-path context:
#   .claude/commands/gaia-{name}.md   — legacy runtime surface
#   plugins/gaia/commands/gaia-{name}.md — retired product-source surface
#
# compound-word-safety convention (E28-S164 / F3 from E28-S128 triage):
#   Every E28-S128 workflow-artifact filename alternation — workflow.yaml,
#   instructions.xml, checklist.md — MUST be prefixed with the anchor
#   `(^|[^-a-z])` to prevent false positives inside compound words. This
#   compound-word-safety anchor is the entire reason the alternation is
#   wrapped rather than naked.
#
#   Without the anchor, a naked `manifest.yaml` pattern would match inside
#   `agent-manifest.yaml`, `skill-manifest.yaml`, `workflow-manifest.yaml`,
#   etc. — yielding spurious failures on perfectly legitimate filenames that
#   merely share the trailing token. The `(^|[^-a-z])` prefix asserts the
#   match begins at the start of a line OR is preceded by a non-hyphen,
#   non-lowercase-letter character (whitespace, quote, slash, colon, etc.).
#
#   Concrete example:
#     - naked `workflow\.yaml\b` would match `agent-workflow.yaml` — WRONG
#     - anchored `(^|[^-a-z])workflow\.yaml\b` skips `agent-workflow.yaml`
#       and only matches `workflow.yaml` as a standalone filename reference
#
#   When extending this PATTERN with a new workflow-artifact token, apply the
#   same anchor unless the token is already safely distinctive (e.g., a full
#   path fragment like `.claude/commands/...` carries its own delimiters).
PATTERN='workflow\.xml|core/protocols|\.resolved/|lifecycle-sequence\.yaml|workflow-manifest\.csv|task-manifest\.csv|skill-manifest\.csv|\.claude/commands/gaia-[a-z0-9-]+\.md|plugins/gaia/commands/gaia-[a-z0-9-]+\.md|(^|[^-a-z])workflow\.yaml\b|(^|[^-a-z])instructions\.xml\b|(^|[^-a-z])checklist\.md\b'

# E28-S128 negative filter — a matched line is treated as a false-positive (and dropped)
# when the match is a shell-variable expansion rather than a literal reference.
# Examples of false-positives:
#   local target="$CHECKPOINT_PATH/$workflow.yaml"          (variable)
#   local lockfile="$CHECKPOINT_PATH/$workflow.yaml.lock"   (variable + suffix)
#   out="${name}.yaml"                                       (parameter expansion)
# These patterns are bash runtime expansions, not stale references to the retired
# workflow.yaml/instructions.xml/checklist.md filenames.

# Files that may contain legacy references for historical or contractual reasons.
#
# Allowlist categories (added by E29-S6 — keep this list in sync when extending):
#   1. Documentation surfaces — anything under docs/, CHANGELOG.md, migration-guide*.
#      Engine/protocol references in prose are historical, not active loads.
#   2. Plugin reference data — plugins/gaia/knowledge/ ships routing/policy tables that
#      may embed legacy paths as data values rather than active loads.
#   3. Parity-guard / regression tests — bats files that ASSERT zero references to a
#      retired token must contain that token as a literal in the assertion body.
#   4. Migration / deletion tooling — gaia-cleanup-legacy-engine.sh, gaia-migrate.sh,
#      and their fixtures intentionally name the v1 paths they detect or delete.
#   5. Fallback helpers — next-step.sh and missing-file-fallback.sh document the v1
#      filenames they gracefully fall back from.
#   6. Skill SKILL.md prose — historical/heuristic/negated mentions in skill bodies
#      (enumerated explicitly per file in the case-block below).
#   7. Skill companion scripts (E29-S6) — plugins/gaia/skills/<skill>/scripts/setup.sh
#      and finalize.sh are V2 native conversions of v1 workflow steps; their header
#      provenance comments legitimately cite "_gaia/...instructions.xml" and the
#      retired filenames (workflow.yaml, instructions.xml, checklist.md) as origin
#      references. Scoped to skill scripts/ subtrees only — top-level
#      plugins/gaia/scripts/finalize.sh would NOT be allowlisted.
