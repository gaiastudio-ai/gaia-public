# e45-s3-finalize-integration.bats — end-to-end finalize.sh + auto-save
#
# Story: E45-S3 (Auto-save session memory at finalize for 24 Phase 1-3 skills)
# AC1, AC3 — full Phase 1-3 finalize invocation produces session memory
# AC-EC1   — Phase 4 finalize does NOT produce auto-save memory entry
#
# Strategy:
#   - Build a temp project with a fake docs/creative-artifacts artifact.
#   - Invoke gaia-product-brief/scripts/finalize.sh from inside that dir.
#   - Confirm a decision-log.md was created in the analyst sidecar.
#   - Run gaia-dev-story finalize from the same tree, confirm no Phase 4
#     auto-save side effect.
