# e28-s141-schema-coverage.bats — schema and migration doc coverage tests
# for E28-S141 (Define config/project-config.yaml schema).
#
# Validates:
#   AC1 — every legacy global.yaml field has exactly one disposition row
#   AC2 — shared set includes required keys
#   AC3 — local set (stays-in-global) includes required keys
#   AC4 — precedence rule stated identically in schema header and MIGRATION doc
#   AC5 — round-trip fixture resolves through resolve-config.sh
