# create-story-token-savings.bats — E63-S11 / Work Item 6 (AC6)
#
# Token-savings benchmark for the /gaia-create-story script-tier wiring.
# Asserts that the post-migration LLM token cost is at least 30% lower than
# the pre-migration baseline, with an absolute target of ~2K tokens saved
# per run (1500-token floor for the absolute check, allowing 25% wiggle room
# against the design intent).
#
# Methodology
# -----------
# The benchmark is a *recorded* measurement, not a live measurement. The
# baseline_total and post_total figures are captured manually from a
# byte-identical fixture (the synthetic E99-S1 story used by the sibling
# create-story-e2e.bats fixture) under two SKILL.md revisions:
#
#   baseline_commit — the last commit before E63 began landing prose-to-
#     script replacements. The baseline exercises the V1 prose pipeline.
#
#   post_commit — the commit that landed E63-S11's SKILL.md rewrite. The
#     post run exercises the thin-orchestrator pipeline.
#
# Token counts include the full /gaia-create-story invocation overhead:
# subagent dispatches (PM Derek, Architect Theo, optional UX Designer
# Christy), Val (ADR-074 contract C2, opus-pinned), and any fix-loop
# attempts. Variance comes from ideation-phase content (AC authoring,
# edge-case ideation) which is unchanged across the two revisions; pinning
# the fixture inputs keeps that variance bounded.
#
# Re-capture trigger
# ------------------
# Refresh the JSON fixture whenever a SKILL.md change exceeds 50 LOC. The
# 50-LOC threshold is the design heuristic from the story Technical Notes
# (significant prose-shape change ⇒ benchmark refresh). Smaller edits do
# not require re-capture; the existing fixture continues to gate the floor.
#
# Models
# ------
# Per ADR-074 contract C2, Val runs on `claude-opus-4-7`; the user-facing
# /gaia-create-story dispatch defaults to Sonnet. Both models are recorded
# in the `model_pin` field of the fixture for audit traceability.
#
# Non-determinism caveats
# -----------------------
# Live token measurements vary slightly across runs due to nucleus sampling
# in the dispatched subagents and cache-hit variance in Val. The benchmark
# is recorded (the bats reads a JSON fixture) precisely to keep CI green
# without paying live LLM costs on every PR. The floor (>= 30%, >= 1500
# absolute saved) carries enough margin to absorb the captured variance.
