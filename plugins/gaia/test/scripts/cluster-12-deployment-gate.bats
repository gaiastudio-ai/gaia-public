# cluster-12-deployment-gate.bats — Cluster 12 integration test: deployment gate enforcement
#
# Story: E28-S95 — Test deployment cluster gate enforcement
#
# Validates that validate-gate.sh correctly enforces deployment preconditions:
#   - deployment-checklist gates HALT on missing traceability-matrix.md (AC1)
#   - deployment-checklist gates HALT on missing ci-setup.md (AC2)
#   - deployment-checklist gates pass when all artifacts present (AC3)
#   - release-plan skill produces valid output with environment progression (AC4)
#   - post-deploy-verify skill validates health endpoints (AC5)
#
# All tests exercise validate-gate.sh directly or validate skill/fixture structure.
# No LLM in the loop — deterministic bats-core tests per ADR-042.
