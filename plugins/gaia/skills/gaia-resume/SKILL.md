## Mission

You are the **GAIA resume system**. Your job is to reconnect a user with an interrupted workflow after context loss or a session break — without re-running completed steps. You do that by (1) listing checkpoint files under `_memory/checkpoints/`, (2) having the user pick one (or auto-picking when only one is active), (3) invoking `checkpoint.sh read` to load the recorded workflow state, (4) invoking `checkpoint.sh validate` to confirm the `files_touched` integrity, and (5) on any validation failure, surfacing a **Proceed / Start fresh / Review** prompt so the user decides how to recover.

This skill is the native Claude Code `/gaia-resume` entry point. Per **ADR-042** (Scripts-over-LLM for Deterministic Operations), all deterministic checkpoint work — listing, reading, sha256 integrity checks — is delegated to `plugins/gaia/scripts/checkpoint.sh`. The skill body only orchestrates the conversation: prompt the user, invoke the script, interpret exit codes, and hand off to the resumed workflow.

## When to Use

Invoke `/gaia-resume` when:
- You have just returned from **context loss** or a **session break** and need to pick up the last workflow where it left off.
- Claude Code was interrupted mid-workflow (e.g., `/gaia-dev-story` crashed, `/gaia-create-story` was paused) and a checkpoint file exists under `_memory/checkpoints/`.
- You want to inspect which workflows have an active checkpoint before deciding to resume, restart, or discard them.

Do NOT invoke `/gaia-resume` when:
- You want to start a fresh workflow from the beginning — use the specific slash command (e.g., `/gaia-dev-story`) directly.
- No checkpoint exists in `_memory/checkpoints/` — this skill will report "no active workflows to resume" and exit.

## Critical Rules

- **Delegate all checkpoint I/O to scripts.** For V1 YAML checkpoints, use `checkpoint.sh read` / `checkpoint.sh validate` (E28-S136). For V2 JSON per-skill checkpoints (ADR-059, E43 cluster), delegate discovery, temp-file filtering, and corruption classification to `resume-discovery.sh` (E43-S7). Do NOT parse checkpoint YAML/JSON, compute sha256 checksums, filter orphan temp files, or re-implement drift / corruption detection in the LLM layer — the scripts are the single source of truth (ADR-042).
- **Never silently resume past a validation failure.** If `checkpoint.sh validate` returns a non-zero exit code, the user MUST be prompted with Proceed / Start fresh / Review. Auto-resuming past drift or missing files is a protocol violation.
- **Never silently resume past a corruption failure.** If `resume-discovery.sh` exits 3 (corrupted checkpoint), the user MUST see the classified `corrupted checkpoint: {path} — {reason}. Suggestion: re-run /gaia-{skill} from scratch, or select a different checkpoint from {dir}.` message and be offered a re-run or fallback path. Never auto-retry past a corrupted checkpoint.
- **Exclude the `completed/` subdirectory when listing active checkpoints.** Archived checkpoints under `_memory/checkpoints/completed/` represent finished workflows and are not resumable. Only live checkpoint files directly under `_memory/checkpoints/` are candidates.
- **Filter orphan temp files and non-canonical filenames during discovery.** The V2 checkpoint writer (`write-checkpoint.sh`) uses an atomic write pattern (`{FINAL}.tmp.$$` renamed to `{FINAL}`). If a crash leaves an orphan temp file behind, the discovery logic (`resume-discovery.sh`) MUST ignore it during resume routing and surface it to the user as cleanup guidance — never attempt to parse a temp file or non-canonical filename as a valid checkpoint.
- **Read-only with respect to checkpoint files.** This skill does NOT write, delete, or modify any checkpoint file. It invokes read/validate/discovery subcommands only; any resumption that proceeds past this skill re-enters the owning workflow, which is responsible for its own checkpoint writes.
- **Never invent a checkpoint or workflow name.** If the user's input does not match a real checkpoint file under `_memory/checkpoints/`, report the mismatch and re-prompt — do not fabricate a resume target.

## Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS`: optional workflow name (the stem of the checkpoint file, e.g., `dev-story-E28-S173`). If supplied, skip the interactive list and jump directly to Step 3 with that workflow name. If omitted, run Step 1 and Step 2.

## Steps

### Step 1 — List Active Checkpoints

Use the **Glob** tool to discover checkpoint files. Both formats coexist during the V1→V2 migration (per ADR-048 program-closing invariant):

- V2 (ADR-059) — the canonical active-workflow format: `_memory/checkpoints/**/*.json` (per-skill subdirectories under the root).
- V1 (legacy, E28-S136) — still honored until the V1 engine retires: `_memory/checkpoints/*.yaml`.
- Exclude: any path containing `_memory/checkpoints/completed/` (archived, not resumable).

Dispatch by extension: `.json` → ADR-059 path (delegate to `resume-checkpoint.sh` and `resume-discovery.sh`); `.yaml` → legacy path (delegate to `checkpoint.sh`). NEVER parse JSON or YAML in the LLM layer.

If the glob returns zero matches, print `No active workflows to resume.` and suggest `/gaia` as the next step. Exit the skill — do not proceed to Step 2.

If the glob returns one or more matches, render a numbered list showing each checkpoint's filename stem (the workflow name) and, if the **Read** tool is available, the `workflow`, `step`, and `timestamp` fields from the YAML header of each file:

```
Active checkpoints:

1. dev-story-E28-S173 — step 7 (green_complete) at 2026-04-17T13:45:22Z
2. create-story-E28-S180 — step 4 at 2026-04-17T09:12:05Z
```

### Step 2 — Select a Checkpoint

- If exactly one checkpoint exists: confirm with the user "Resume `{name}`? [y/n]". On `y`, proceed to Step 3 with that name. On `n`, exit with "Resume cancelled."
- If multiple checkpoints exist: ask the user to pick by number or workflow name. If the input is ambiguous or does not match, re-prompt — do not guess.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` was supplied, skip this step and use that value as the selected workflow name.

### Step 3 — Read the Checkpoint

Dispatch by checkpoint format:

**ADR-059 JSON checkpoint (V2 — per-skill, under `_memory/checkpoints/{skill}/`):**

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resume-checkpoint.sh" read --skill "{skill_name}" --latest
```

Or if a specific checkpoint path was selected:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resume-checkpoint.sh" read --path "{path}"
```

On exit 0, the script emits the checkpoint JSON on stdout. Capture `skill_name`, `step_number`, `timestamp`, `key_variables`, `output_paths`, `file_checksums`, and optional `skill_md_content_hash` for use in Step 5.

On exit 2 ("checkpoint not found"), report the missing skill to the user and return to Step 1.

On exit 4 ("corrupted checkpoint"), defer to the corruption-classification message already emitted by `resume-discovery.sh` (via `resume-checkpoint.sh`). Surface the classified message verbatim and offer the user a re-run or earlier-checkpoint path — never auto-retry past a corrupted checkpoint. This is the handoff contract E43-S6 verifies; E43-S7 owns the classification.

**V1 YAML checkpoint (legacy — still honored during the V1→V2 transition):**

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/checkpoint.sh" read --workflow "{selected_name}"
```

Exit-code semantics for the legacy path are unchanged from E28-S136.

On exit 1 (usage error) from either helper, surface the stderr message verbatim and exit the skill.

### Step 4 — Validate File Integrity

Invoke the appropriate validator for the checkpoint format.

**ADR-059 JSON checkpoint:**

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resume-checkpoint.sh" validate \
  --path "{checkpoint_path}" --skill-md "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/{skill_name}/SKILL.md"
```

The validator walks the checkpoint's `file_checksums` object, recomputes SHA-256 on each listed path, and compares against the recorded hash. When `skill_md_content_hash` is present in the checkpoint, the validator also recomputes SHA-256 on the referenced SKILL.md.

**V1 YAML checkpoint (legacy):**

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/checkpoint.sh" validate --workflow "{selected_name}"
```

**Exit-code table (unified across both paths):**

- **exit 0 — clean.** All recorded files exist; every sha256 matches; SKILL.md hash matches (if recorded). Report `All file_checksums match — safe to resume.` and proceed directly to Step 6.
- **exit 1 — drift.** One or more files recorded in `file_checksums` have changed (different sha256) since the checkpoint was written. The validator prints `drift: <path>` lines with both the recorded and recomputed hashes. Proceed to Step 5 with the drift list.
- **exit 2 — missing file.** One or more recorded files have been deleted since the checkpoint was written. The validator prints `missing file: <path>` lines. Proceed to Step 5 with the missing list.
- **exit 3 — SKILL.md content-hash mismatch (ADR-059 only).** The on-disk SKILL.md differs from the hash recorded in the checkpoint. Proceed to Step 5 with the SKILL.md-drift branch — present the two-option prompt `[Proceed with acknowledgment] [Abort]` (NOT the three-option drift prompt — a `git diff` of SKILL.md is not user-actionable at resume time).
- **exit 4 — corrupted checkpoint JSON (ADR-059 only).** Defer to the corruption path from E43-S7.

Never silently resume past a non-zero exit — always branch into Step 5 so the user sees the mismatch and chooses the recovery path.

### Step 5 — Proceed / Start Fresh / Review

When validation returns exit 1 (drift) or exit 2 (missing file), render the list of affected files and present the three-option prompt:

```
Validation detected {N} changed file(s) since the checkpoint was written:

- {path} — DRIFT (sha256 does not match)
- {path} — DELETED (file no longer exists)

Choose how to recover:

[Proceed]      Resume anyway — the workflow re-enters at the recorded step.
               The changed files will be re-processed by the workflow.

[Start fresh]  Discard this checkpoint and re-run the workflow from the
               beginning. The checkpoint file is left in place; the workflow
               will overwrite it on the next write.

[Review]       Show `git diff HEAD -- {paths}` for each changed file so you
               can inspect the delta, then re-prompt with these three options.
```

Wait for the user to pick exactly one of **Proceed**, **Start fresh**, or **Review**.

- **Proceed:** continue to Step 6.
- **Start fresh:** exit the skill and suggest re-running the owning slash command (e.g., `/gaia-dev-story`) from its normal entry point.
- **Review:** for each changed file, run `git diff HEAD -- {path}` (if the project is a git repo) or show a summary of the checksum mismatch (if not), then loop back to the Proceed / Start fresh / Review prompt.

### Step 5a — SKILL.md-drift prompt (validate exit 3, ADR-059 only)

When validation exits 3, the on-disk SKILL.md for the owning skill has a different content hash than what was recorded at checkpoint time. Steps and contracts in the skill body may have changed between the checkpoint write and this resume attempt. Present exactly two options — no `[Review]` because a `git diff` of SKILL.md is not user-actionable at resume time (E45 covers the broader SKILL.md-versioning story):

```
SKILL.md has changed since this checkpoint was written.
Steps and contracts may differ.

  recorded: sha256:{hex}
  recomputed: sha256:{hex}
  SKILL.md path: {path}

Choose how to proceed:

[Proceed with acknowledgment]  Resume anyway. You accept that the skill
                               body has shifted; downstream steps may
                               behave differently than the checkpoint
                               captured.

[Abort]                        Exit without resuming. Re-invoke the
                               owning skill from step 1 when ready.
```

Wait for the user to pick one. On **Proceed with acknowledgment**, continue to Step 6. On **Abort**, exit the skill with a clear log entry.

### Step 6 — Hand Off to the Owning Workflow

Once validation is clean (Step 4 exit 0), the user chose **Proceed** in Step 5 (drift / missing), or the user chose **Proceed with acknowledgment** in Step 5a (SKILL.md drift):

- Announce: `Resuming {skill_name} at step {step_number + 1}.` For ADR-059 JSON checkpoints, the routing target is explicitly `step_number + 1` — one step past the checkpoint-recorded step. The owning skill MUST implement resume-aware step dispatching so that passing it `step_number + 1` is sufficient to skip completed work. E43-S6 verifies the contract; the individual skills (wired by E43-S2..S5) satisfy it.
- Reconstitute `key_variables` from the checkpoint into the resumed context: every key in the recorded `key_variables` object is restored verbatim, including multi-line strings, embedded JSON, and shell metacharacters (these are written escape-safe by `write-checkpoint.sh` and round-trip cleanly through `jq -c .`).
- Announce `output_paths`: artifacts listed in the checkpoint are already produced — the resumed skill MUST load them, NOT regenerate them, and MUST NOT write duplicate content to the same paths.
- Instruct the user to re-invoke the owning slash command (derived from the checkpoint's `skill_name` field — for example, `gaia-create-prd` → `/gaia-create-prd`). The owning workflow is responsible for reading its own checkpoint via `resume-checkpoint.sh read` on re-entry and skipping to `step_number + 1`.
- This skill exits after the handoff. It does NOT execute workflow steps itself.

## Resume Contract

This section summarizes the five user-observable flows `/gaia-resume` implements against ADR-059 (`architecture.md §10.31.3`). Reviewers should be able to understand the resume contract from this skill alone, without chasing into ADRs. Each flow is verified by a bats case under `plugins/gaia/tests/e43-s6-resume-contract.bats`.

**Example ADR-059 v1 JSON checkpoint (schema shape — verbatim from `architecture.md §10.31.3`, extended with the optional `skill_md_content_hash` field):**

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "step_number": 3,
  "skill_name": "gaia-create-prd",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-24T14:30:00.123456Z",
  "key_variables": { "project_name": "Example", "prd_version": "1.0.0" },
  "output_paths": ["docs/planning-artifacts/prd/prd.md"],
  "file_checksums": { "docs/planning-artifacts/prd/prd.md": "sha256:a1b2c3..." },
  "skill_md_content_hash": "sha256:d4e5f6..."
}
```

### Flow 1 — Checksum-pass resume (VCP-CPT-03, AC1)

- Inputs: valid checkpoint at `step_number=3`; every path in `file_checksums` exists on disk with the recorded hash.
- `resume-checkpoint.sh validate` returns exit 0.
- Skill reports `All file_checksums match — safe to resume.`, reconstitutes `key_variables`, and routes to `step_number + 1` (step 4). No user interaction required.

### Flow 2 — Checksum-mismatch drift (VCP-CPT-04, AC2)

- Inputs: valid checkpoint; exactly one path's on-disk SHA-256 no longer matches the recorded hash.
- `resume-checkpoint.sh validate` returns exit 1 and prints `drift: {path}` lines with both `recorded: sha256:...` and `recomputed: sha256:...`.
- Skill presents exactly three options: `[Proceed] [Start fresh] [Review]` (Step 5). On `[Review]`, the skill runs `git diff HEAD -- {path}` per drifted path, then re-prompts.

### Flow 3 — Missing checkpoint (VCP-CPT-05, AC3)

- Inputs: no checkpoint exists under `_memory/checkpoints/{skill_name}/` — directory absent, empty, or filtered to zero valid JSONs.
- `resume-checkpoint.sh list --skill {skill_name}` returns exit 2 and emits `No checkpoint found for skill: {skill_name}` plus a list of resumable alternatives across other skill directories.
- Skill surfaces the message verbatim and exits without starting the skill from step 1 — never silently fall through.

### Flow 4 — SKILL.md version mismatch (VCP-CPT-07, AC4)

- Inputs: checkpoint's recorded `skill_md_content_hash` differs from the current on-disk SKILL.md content hash (the skill body has been edited between checkpoint write and resume attempt).
- `resume-checkpoint.sh validate` returns exit 3 and prints `SKILL.md has changed since this checkpoint was written. Steps and contracts may differ.` with both hashes and the SKILL.md path.
- Skill presents exactly two options (Step 5a): `[Proceed with acknowledgment] [Abort]`. No `[Review]` — a `git diff` of SKILL.md is not user-actionable at resume time.

### Flow 5 — Step reconstruction parity (VCP-CPT-08, AC5)

- Inputs: a checkpoint at `step_number=5` for `/gaia-create-prd` (representative multi-step skill).
- After `/gaia-resume` hands off and `/gaia-create-prd` re-enters at step 6: every `key_variables` field is available in the resumed context; every `output_paths` artifact is loaded (not regenerated); no duplicate writes; final artifacts are byte-identical to a reference uninterrupted run (modulo timestamps).
- This is an **LLM-checkable** flow (Tier 2 per `test-plan.md §11.46.20`). The scripted bats suite verifies the *mechanical* contract (read / validate / list semantics); VCP-CPT-08 is executed as a manual end-to-end run and compared against a reference fixture.

### Exit-code table (validate)

| Exit | Meaning | User-visible prompt |
|------|---------|--------------------|
| 0 | Clean — all checksums match, SKILL.md unchanged | None; auto-proceed |
| 1 | File drift — one or more `file_checksums` entries mismatched | `[Proceed] [Start fresh] [Review]` |
| 2 | Missing file — one or more `output_paths` deleted | `[Proceed] [Start fresh] [Review]` |
| 3 | SKILL.md content-hash mismatch | `[Proceed with acknowledgment] [Abort]` |
| 4 | Corrupted checkpoint JSON | Defer to E43-S7 corruption handler |

## V2 Checkpoint Discovery (E43, per-skill JSON checkpoints)

The V2 checkpoint infrastructure introduced by E43 writes per-skill JSON checkpoints under `_memory/checkpoints/{skill_name}/{ISO8601-microseconds-Z}-step-{N}.json`. When the user requests resume for a V2 skill (any of the 24 Phase 1–3 skills wired in E43-S2..S5), delegate discovery, temp-file filtering, and corruption classification to `resume-discovery.sh`:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resume-discovery.sh" "{skill_name}"
```

### Reserved exit codes for V2 resume

- **0 — success.** The path of the latest valid checkpoint is printed to stdout; any cleanup guidance (orphan temp files, non-canonical filenames) is emitted BEFORE the path so the user can clean up their workspace.
- **1 — usage / invalid argument.** Generic failure exit.
- **2 — no checkpoint found for skill** (after filtering). The user has never run this skill or all files in the skill directory were filtered as temp / non-canonical. Suggest `/gaia-{skill_name}` to start fresh.
- **3 — corrupted checkpoint.** The latest candidate failed to parse as JSON. The script emits a classified message of shape `corrupted checkpoint: {path} — {reason}. Suggestion: re-run /gaia-{skill_name} from scratch, or select a different checkpoint from {dir}.` along with any additional corrupted checkpoint paths and a count of uncorrupted earlier checkpoints (user may resume from an earlier step rather than re-run from scratch).

### Temp-file and non-canonical filtering

`resume-discovery.sh` filters out any file matching these patterns from the candidate list and reports them as cleanup guidance:

- `{canonical}.tmp.{pid}` — the atomic-write temp produced by `write-checkpoint.sh` and renamed on successful write; surviving tmp files indicate a crash mid-write.
- `.tmp-*.json` — leading-dot alternate convention (defensive).
- `*.partial` — alternate convention (defensive).
- Any filename not matching the canonical pattern `{ISO8601-microseconds-Z}-step-{N}.json` — reported under cleanup guidance but never parsed as a checkpoint.

Cleanup guidance is informational only — `/gaia-resume` proceeds with the filtered candidate list without blocking on leftover files.

### Corruption-detection control flow

```text
candidates = list_checkpoints(skill_dir)
    # filter out temp-file patterns and non-canonical filenames;
    # report them as cleanup guidance before any resume action.
latest = candidates.sort_by_timestamp.last
if latest is None:
    emit "no checkpoint found for {skill}"; exit 2
try:
    checkpoint = json.load(latest)
except JSONDecodeError as reason:
    emit "corrupted checkpoint: {latest} — {reason}. Suggestion: re-run /gaia-{skill} from scratch."
    # also report earlier corrupted checkpoints and count of uncorrupted ones
    exit 3
# continue with checksum verification (E43-S6) …
```

No code path emits an unhandled parse error, stack trace, or bare `command not found` to the user — every error is caught, classified, and reported with an actionable message. This is the corruption-handling contract operationalized by E43-S7 (ADR-059 resilience clause).
