## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-ci-edit/scripts/setup.sh

## Mission

You are editing the `ci_cd.promotion_chain` array in `global.yaml`. You read the current chain, present a CRUD menu (add, remove, edit, reorder), validate changes against the E20-S1 schema, write back preserving the canonical field order (id, name, branch, ci_provider, merge_strategy, ci_checks), and cascade updates to dependent files.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/testing/workflows/ci-edit` workflow (Cluster 11, story E28-S86, ADR-042). It follows the canonical skill pattern established by E28-S66 (code-review).

**Write context:** This skill uses `allowed-tools: Read Grep Glob Bash Write Edit` because it modifies `global.yaml` and cascades changes to CI config files and test-environment.yaml.

**Foundation script integration (ADR-042):** This skill invokes `validate-gate.sh` from `plugins/gaia/scripts/` for conditional post-edit CI gate verification. Per E28-S199, `finalize.sh` runs the `ci_setup_exists` gate only when `setup.sh` observed a prior `docs/test-artifacts/ci-setup.md` at invocation time (tracked via a runtime marker at `.gaia/run-state/ci-edit-had-prior-setup`). On fresh fixtures with no prior setup, the gate is skipped so the finalize exits 0 cleanly; when a prior setup was observed the gate runs as a regression guard against edits that erase the setup file. Deterministic operations (config resolution, gate verification, YAML manipulation) belong in bash scripts, not LLM prompts.

**Schema reference (ADR-033):** The promotion chain uses the multi-environment format defined in `global.yaml`. Each entry has: id, name, branch, ci_provider, merge_strategy, ci_checks. The canonical field order MUST be preserved on every write-back operation to ensure round-trip fidelity through YAML parsers.

## Critical Rules

- The `id` field of every entry is immutable (ADR-033). Edits that attempt to change `id` MUST be rejected.
- Every CRUD operation MUST be followed by full chain re-validation. Partial updates are not permitted.
- An operation that would leave zero entries in the chain is ALWAYS blocked. The chain must contain at least 1 environment at all times (AC-EC6).
- When `promotion_chain` is an empty array in `global.yaml`, the skill MUST handle gracefully and allow adding the first environment without error (AC-EC2).
- If the `ci_cd` section contains malformed YAML, the skill MUST detect the parse failure, report the malformed section, and refuse to write changes (AC-EC4).
- The `validate-gate.sh` foundation script (E28-S15) MUST be present and executable. If missing or not executable, HALT with: "validate-gate.sh not found or not executable -- dependency E28-S15 must be installed first" (AC-EC3, AC-EC5).
- Remove and Edit operations MUST run the safety scan first (checkpoints, stories, test-environment.yaml) and require explicit user confirmation when references are found.
- Only the `ci_cd.promotion_chain` block in `global.yaml` may be modified -- all other fields and comments MUST be preserved exactly.
- Sprint-status.yaml is NEVER written by this skill (Sprint-Status Write Safety rule).
- The canonical field order (id, name, branch, ci_provider, merge_strategy, ci_checks) MUST be preserved on write-back (AC4).

## Steps

### Step 1 -- Load Current Promotion Chain

- Read `global.yaml` in full. Preserve all fields and comments.
- Check whether `ci_cd` block exists and contains a `promotion_chain` array.
- If `ci_cd` block absent or `promotion_chain` field missing: display "No promotion chain configured. Run `/gaia-ci-setup` first." and HALT.
- If `promotion_chain` is an empty array: allow adding the first environment (AC-EC2).
- If YAML parsing fails on the `ci_cd` section: report the malformed section and refuse to proceed (AC-EC4).
- Render the current chain as a formatted table: position, id, branch, environment, merge_strategy, ci_provider.

### Step 2 -- Present Operation Menu

- Present the CRUD operation menu:
  - `[a]` add -- insert a new environment into the chain
  - `[r]` remove -- delete an existing environment (with safety scan)
  - `[e]` edit -- modify fields of an existing environment (id is immutable)
  - `[o]` order -- reorder the chain (warns on position 0 change)
  - `[v]` view -- re-render the current chain table
  - `[x]` exit -- close without writing

### Step 3 -- Add Operation

- Prompt for each required field in canonical order: id (slug format), name, branch, ci_provider (enum), merge_strategy (enum), ci_checks (optional array).
- Ask for insertion position (0-based index, or append).
- Reject duplicate id or branch values.
- Proceed to validation step.

### Step 4 -- Remove Operation

- Prompt for the id of the environment to remove.
- If chain length is 1: HALT -- "Cannot remove the last environment. The promotion chain must have at least 1 environment. Add a replacement first, or use `/gaia-ci-setup` to reset the chain." (AC-EC6)
- Run safety scan (checkpoints, stories, test-environment.yaml).
- If references found: require explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
- Proceed to validation step.

### Step 5 -- Edit Operation

- Prompt for the id of the environment to edit. Display current field values.
- Allow modification of: branch, name, test_tiers, merge_strategy, auto_merge, approval_required, ci_provider, ci_checks.
- If user attempts to edit `id`: reject with "Field 'id' is immutable (ADR-033). To rename, remove this entry and add a new one."
- Run safety scan before applying if branch is being changed.
- Proceed to validation step.

### Step 6 -- Reorder Operation

- Render the current chain as a numbered list.
- Prompt for the new order as a comma-separated list of ids.
- If reorder changes position 0: warn that this changes the PR target for all feature branches and require explicit confirmation.
- Proceed to validation step.

### Step 7 -- Validate, List Cascade Targets, Confirm, Write, and Cascade

- Validate the modified chain: minimum 1 entry, unique ids, unique branches, required fields, valid enums, id slug pattern.
- If validation fails: display violations and return to the operation menu without writing.
- **List cascade targets BEFORE the confirmation prompt (AC1, TC-GR37-32):** enumerate every file that will be affected by this edit so the user understands the blast radius before committing. The listing MUST include the literal phrase "cascade targets" or "affected" so the listing is discoverable in the rendered output. The targets are:
  1. **Affected workflow files** — CI workflow files under `.github/workflows/*.yml` whose triggers reference any branch in `ci_cd.promotion_chain`. Resolve by globbing `.github/workflows/` and grepping for `branches:` entries that match a chain branch. Print each path and the matched branch.
  2. **Affected `test-environment.yaml` tiers** — read `docs/test-artifacts/test-environment.yaml` (or the project-configured path) and list every tier whose `chain_id` matches the id of the chain entry being added, removed, edited, or reordered. Per architecture §10.24.3, `chain_id` is the optional cross-reference from a tier to a `ci_cd.promotion_chain[].id`. Print each tier name, the matching `chain_id`, and the action (will be reassigned, orphaned, or unchanged).
  3. **`docs/test-artifacts/ci-setup.md`** — flagged for regeneration after the write completes.
- Render the cascade-target listing as a structured block immediately above the confirmation prompt:

  ```
  Cascade targets — these files will be affected:
    Workflows: <path>:<branch>, ...
    test-environment.yaml tiers: <tier>:<chain_id>, ...
    ci-setup.md (will be regenerated)
  ```

- Display the confirmation prompt: "Apply this edit and cascade to the listed targets? [y/n]". HALT without writing on `n`.
- Write the updated chain back to `global.yaml`. Only `ci_cd.promotion_chain` may be modified.
- Preserve the canonical field order on write-back (AC4): id, name, branch, ci_provider, merge_strategy, ci_checks.
- Cascade updates: update CI workflow triggers if branch names changed, update test-environment.yaml tier mappings, regenerate ci-setup.md.
- **On cascade failure (AC2, TC-GR37-33):** report the specific cascade failure with BOTH (a) the failing file path and (b) the reason for failure. Do NOT rollback `global.yaml` silently. Use this exact format so the error is unambiguous and grep-discoverable:

  ```
  Cascade failure:
    path: <absolute or repo-relative file path that failed>
    reason: <one-line description of why — e.g., "permission denied", "yaml parse error: <detail>", "schema mismatch in tier <name>", "workflow file referenced branch <x> but no rule applied">
  ```

  Every cascade failure message MUST include both the `path:` line and the `reason:` line. Silent failures, generic "cascade error" messages, or rollback-without-diagnosis are NOT permitted. The user must always be able to identify the failing file and the cause without re-running the skill.

### Step 8 -- Summary

- Display: operation performed, entries affected, position 0 changes, cascade results, warnings.
- Remind user to commit updated files on a feature branch.
