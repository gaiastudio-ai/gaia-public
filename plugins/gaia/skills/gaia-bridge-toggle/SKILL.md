description: Toggle the Test Execution Bridge on or off by flipping test_execution_bridge.bridge_enabled in _gaia/_config/global.yaml, preserving comments and YAML formatting. Idempotent — no write when already in target state. Under the native plugin, the flip takes effect immediately — no config rebuild step is required. Use via /gaia-bridge-enable or /gaia-bridge-disable. Native Claude Code conversion of the legacy bridge-toggle workflow (E28-S111, Cluster 14).

## Mission

You are toggling the Test Execution Bridge. The bridge flag lives at `test_execution_bridge.bridge_enabled` in `_gaia/_config/global.yaml`. When enabled, dev-story and review workflows run real test runners via the bridge (Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3) and emit evidence under `docs/test-artifacts/test-results/`. When disabled, workflows fall back to narrative test reporting.

Two slash commands front this skill via wrapper aliases:
- `/gaia-bridge-enable` → delegates here with mode=`enable`
- `/gaia-bridge-disable` → delegates here with mode=`disable`

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy bridge-toggle workflow at `_gaia/core/workflows/bridge-toggle/instructions.xml` (brief Cluster 14, story E28-S111). The legacy 69-line XML body is preserved here as explicit prose per ADR-041. No workflow engine, no engine-specific XML step tags.

## Critical Rules

- **Modify global.yaml in place, preserving ALL comments, key ordering, and formatting.** Never regenerate the full file. A successful toggle emits a single-line change.
- **Use regex-based in-place edit targeting ONLY the `bridge_enabled:` line — never regenerate the full file.** Pattern: `/^(\s+bridge_enabled:\s*)(true|false)/m`. Replace capture group 2 with the target value.
- **Idempotent: if the flag is already in the target state, do NOT write the file.** A byte-level diff must show zero changes. Report `Bridge already {enabled|disabled}` and exit with status ok.
- **Fail fast when the test_execution_bridge block is missing (AC-EC2).** Emit `test_execution_bridge block missing — run /gaia-ci-setup first` and exit non-zero. Do NOT create a new block silently.
- **The flag flip takes effect immediately.** Under the native plugin there is no pre-compiled config cache to refresh (ADR-044/ADR-048 retired the `.resolved/` chain). Downstream workflows read `global.yaml` directly via `resolve-config.sh` on their next invocation.

## Inputs

1. **Mode** — `enable` or `disable`, via `$ARGUMENTS`. When invoked via the wrapper aliases, the mode is hard-coded in the wrapper SKILL.md.

## Pipeline Overview

The skill runs five steps in strict order, mirroring the legacy `bridge-toggle/instructions.xml`:

1. **Read Current Bridge State** — extract bridge_enabled from global.yaml
2. **Idempotency Check** — no write if current == target
3. **Write Updated State** — regex-based in-place edit
4. **Post-Flip Checks (Enable Only)** — detect test-environment.yaml and validate
5. **Post-Toggle Summary** — confirm new state (no rebuild step — native plugin reads global.yaml directly)

## Step 1 — Read Current Bridge State

- Read `_gaia/_config/global.yaml`.
- Extract the `test_execution_bridge.bridge_enabled` value.
- **AC-EC2 / AC3:** If the `test_execution_bridge` section is missing entirely, or the section exists but the `bridge_enabled` key is missing, treat `bridge_enabled` as `false`. In the missing-section case, fail fast with `test_execution_bridge block missing — run /gaia-ci-setup first` and exit non-zero — do NOT create a new block silently.
- Capture the raw file bytes for idempotency verification.
- Report: `Current bridge state: {enabled|disabled}`.

## Step 2 — Idempotency Check

- Compare the current state against the target mode (`enable` → `true`, `disable` → `false`).
- If `current_state == target_state`: report `Bridge already {enabled|disabled}` and exit with status ok. Do NOT write global.yaml. A byte-level diff must show zero changes.

## Step 3 — Write Updated State

- Use a regex-based in-place edit (`Edit` tool) to update ONLY the `bridge_enabled:` line within the `test_execution_bridge:` section.
- Regex pattern: `/^(\s+bridge_enabled:\s*)(true|false)/m` — replace capture group 2 with the target value.
- This preserves inline comments on the same line and all surrounding YAML content.
- If the `test_execution_bridge` section is missing: emit the error from Step 1 (`test_execution_bridge section not found in global.yaml — cannot toggle. Add the section first (see ADR-028 §10.20.7).`) and exit non-zero.
- Write the updated content back to global.yaml.

## Step 4 — Post-Flip Checks (Enable Only)

- **disable mode:** skip this step entirely (AC7). Set `post_flip_result = {kind: "skipped", reason: "disable-mode"}` and proceed to Step 5.
- **enable mode, no state change (idempotent path):** skip (Step 2 already exited). Set `post_flip_result = {kind: "skipped", reason: "idempotent"}` and proceed to Step 5.
- **enable mode, state changed:** stat `docs/test-artifacts/test-environment.yaml` (resolved relative to `{project-root}`):
  - **present + valid:** collect detected runners (name + tier) for inclusion in Step 5's summary. Proceed.
  - **present + invalid:** collect schema errors as warnings. Per AC5, do NOT roll back the flag flip — the user can repair the manifest and re-run `/gaia-bridge-enable` if desired. Proceed.
  - **absent (non-YOLO):** render the 3-option prompt — none of the options auto-invoke any sub-workflow. Ask the user to select:
    - `[a]` Run `/gaia-brownfield` to auto-generate test-environment.yaml (next-step suggestion — NOT auto-invoked)
    - `[b]` Copy `docs/test-artifacts/test-environment.yaml.example` to `docs/test-artifacts/test-environment.yaml` and customize
    - `[c]` Skip — bridge is enabled but will fail-fast at Layer 1 with a clear error message until the manifest is created
  - **absent (YOLO):** auto-select option `[c]` Skip and log `Bridge is enabled but docs/test-artifacts/test-environment.yaml is missing — Layer 1 will fail-fast until the manifest is created.`
- Pass `post_flip_result` to Step 5.

(Removed AC-EC9 "serialization against concurrent /gaia-build-configs" — under the native plugin there is no concurrent build-configs process to race against; ADR-044/ADR-048 retired the pre-compilation step.)

## Step 5 — Post-Toggle Summary

- Display a summary containing: previous state, new state, mode, whether a write occurred.
- If `mode == enable` and `post_flip_result.kind == 'present_valid'`: include the detected runners table (name + tier).
- If `mode == enable` and `post_flip_result.kind == 'present_invalid'`: include the schema validation errors as warnings. The `bridge_enabled` flag is NOT rolled back (AC5).
- If `mode == enable` and `post_flip_result.kind == 'absent'`: include the user's selected option (a/b/c) or the YOLO auto-skip warning.
- **AC6 — the summary confirms the flag change is effective immediately.** Under the native plugin (ADR-044/ADR-048) there is no pre-compiled config cache to refresh — downstream workflows read `global.yaml` directly via `scripts/resolve-config.sh` on their next invocation.
- If `mode == disable`: the summary only confirms the new state. No post-flip check output (AC7 — Step 4 was skipped).

## Edge Cases

- **AC-EC2 — test_execution_bridge block missing:** fail fast with `test_execution_bridge block missing — run /gaia-ci-setup first`. Do NOT create the block silently.
- **AC-EC9 (retired under ADR-048):** the legacy concurrent-/gaia-build-configs race no longer applies — native-plugin resolution is per-invocation, not pre-compiled.
- **Idempotent path:** zero bytes written; zero side effects.
- **YAML parse errors on read:** surface the parser error; do NOT attempt a regex edit on malformed YAML.
