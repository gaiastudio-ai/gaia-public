# sprint-state-wrapper-sync.bats — ADR-055 §10.29.3 wrapper-sync invariant.
#
# Verifies the secondary-copy wrapper at
#   plugins/gaia/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/sprint-state.sh
# accepts every subcommand the canonical
#   plugins/gaia/scripts/sprint-state.sh
# advertises in its `--help` output.
#
# Per ADR-055 §10.29.3 the canonical script is the source of truth. The
# wrapper MUST accept the full subcommand surface; byte-identical diff is
# NOT required (the wrapper may transform args or add skill-local context).
# At the time this test was added the two files happen to be byte-identical
# duplicates, so every subcommand is trivially supported. The test is
# nonetheless a regression guard: any future canonical addition that lands
# without a matching wrapper update will fail this test mechanically rather
# than relying on reviewer vigilance.

# extract_subcommands <help-text-file>
#   Parse the canonical `--help` output and emit one subcommand token per
#   line on stdout. The canonical help format prints a "Usage:" block where
#   each line is of the form
#     "  sprint-state.sh <subcommand>   <args...>"
#   The second whitespace-separated token on each such line is the
#   subcommand name. The block ends at the first non-indented line.
#
#   The `--help` token is excluded — it is a flag, not a subcommand, and
#   wrappers may handle it specially (or print their own help).
#
#   awk pattern uses explicit start/stop state instead of awk's range form
#   to avoid the well-known awk range-bug (gaia-shell-idioms) where
#   /start/,/end/ silently mis-bounds when start and end overlap on a line.
