## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-product-brief/scripts/setup.sh

## Mission

You are facilitating a collaborative discovery session to produce a product brief. Guide the user through vision, target users, problem statement, proposed solution, scope, risks, competitive landscape, and success metrics, then emit a structured product brief artifact at `docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-*.md` for downstream consumers (e.g., `/gaia-create-prd`).

**Agent:** `analyst` (Elena) — the analyst subagent facilitates discovery and drafts the brief sections. Persona definition lives at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/analyst.md`; do not duplicate the persona content here.

**Template:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/product-brief-template.md` — structural source for the 9 required sections. The template's H2 headings are the post_complete gate targets and must not be renamed.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/lifecycle/workflows/1-analysis/create-product-brief` workflow (brief §Cluster 4, story P4-S2). The step ordering, prompts, and output location follow the legacy `instructions.xml` mechanically — do not restructure, re-prompt, or reorder sections.

## Critical Rules

- All sections must be collaboratively developed with the user — do not invent vision, users, or metrics.
- Ground every claim in upstream artifacts (brainstorm, market research, domain research, technical research) when available; otherwise elicit from the user.
- The output file path is `docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-{slug}.md` — downstream consumers glob on this pattern, so do not relocate it.
- Mechanical port: the eight legacy steps below must appear in this exact order.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Discover Inputs

> **Loading strategy: INDEX_GUIDED per ADR-062.** Brainstorm output and
> research artifacts can be 10K+ tokens each. For each upstream artifact,
> load the index/TOC first (heading scan with `grep -nE '^#{1,3} '` or read
> `index.md` if present) — do NOT read the full body up front. Fetch named
> sections on demand in later steps (`sed -n '/^## Section/,/^## /p`). If an
> artifact has no parseable headings, fall back to FULL_LOAD for that file
> only and log the fallback in the checkpoint.

- Scan prior brainstorm output if available (heading scan over `docs/creative-artifacts/brainstorm-*.md`).
- Scan market research if available (heading scan over `docs/creative-artifacts/market-research*.md`).
- Scan domain research if available (heading scan over `docs/creative-artifacts/domain-research*.md`).
- Scan technical research if available (heading scan over `docs/creative-artifacts/tech-research*.md`).
- Scan any other creative outputs under `docs/creative-artifacts/` for relevant indexes.
- Summarize what upstream context was found (section list, not full content) and flag any missing inputs to the user before proceeding.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 1 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER"`

### Step 2 — Vision Statement

- Collaboratively craft the vision statement with the user.
- Incorporate insights from prior analysis if available.
- Elena (analyst) asks the user: **"What is the core vision for this product?"** — wait for a response before moving on.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 2 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER"`

### Step 3 — Target Users

- Define user personas based on research.
- For each persona capture: name, role, goals, pain points, context.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 3 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER"`

### Step 4 — Problem Statement

- Articulate the core problem being solved.
- Ground the statement in user research, market findings, and domain landscape where available.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 4 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER"`

### Step 5 — Proposed Solution

- Define the high-level solution approach.
- Capture key features and differentiators.
- Reference technical research for technology selection rationale if available.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 5 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER"`

### Step 6 — Scope, Risks and Competitive Landscape

- Define what is in-scope for this product and what is explicitly out of scope.
- Document known risks, dependencies, and assumptions the solution depends on.
- Summarize competitive landscape from upstream brainstorm and market research — key competitors, positioning, and differentiation.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 6 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER"`

### Step 7 — Success Metrics

- Define measurable KPIs and success criteria.
- Include both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 7 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER"`

### Step 8 — Generate Output

Use the template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/product-brief-template.md` as the structural source for the 9 required sections. Do not invent alternate section headings — they are the exact post_complete gate targets enforced by `scripts/finalize.sh` against `docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-*.md`.

Write a structured product brief to `docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-{slug}.md` containing the exact sections below, in order:

- **Vision Statement** — core product vision
- **Target Users** — user personas (name, role, goals, pain points, context for each)
- **Problem Statement** — core problem being solved, grounded in research
- **Proposed Solution** — high-level solution approach
- **Key Features** — feature list with differentiators
- **Scope and Boundaries** — what is in-scope and what is explicitly out of scope
- **Risks and Assumptions** — known risks, dependencies, and assumptions
- **Competitive Landscape** — summary of competitive positioning from upstream research
- **Success Metrics** — measurable KPIs and success criteria
- **Next Steps** — per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/lifecycle-sequence.yaml` (routing table ships inside the plugin under ADR-041's `knowledge/` convention; the legacy v1 location `_gaia/_config/lifecycle-sequence.yaml` is retired and no longer used)

Where `{slug}` is a short kebab-case slug derived from the product vision (e.g., `product-brief-ai-code-review.md`).

> After artifact write: run open-question detection snippet
> `!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/detect-open-questions.sh docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-${SLUG}.md`

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 8 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER" --paths docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-${SLUG}.md`

### Step 9 — Val Auto-Fix Loop (E44-S2 / ADR-058)

> Reuses the canonical pattern at `gaia-public/plugins/gaia/skills/gaia-val-validate/SKILL.md`
> § "Auto-Fix Loop Pattern". Do not duplicate the spec here; cite this anchor.

**Guards (run before invocation):**

- Artifact-existence guard (AC-EC3): if not exists `docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-{slug}.md` -> skip Val auto-review and exit (no Val invocation, no checkpoint, no iteration log).
- Val-skill-availability guard (AC-EC6): if `/gaia-val-validate` SKILL.md is not resolvable at runtime -> warn `Val auto-review unavailable: /gaia-val-validate not found`, preserve the artifact, and exit cleanly.

**Loop:**

1. iteration = 1.
2. Invoke `/gaia-val-validate` with `artifact_path = docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-{slug}.md`, `artifact_type = product-brief`.
3. If findings is empty: proceed past the loop.
4. If findings contains only INFO: log informational notes, proceed past the loop.
5. If findings contains CRITICAL or WARNING:
     a. Apply a fix to `docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-{slug}.md` addressing the findings.
     b. Append an iteration log record to checkpoint `custom.val_loop_iterations`.
     c. iteration += 1.
     d. If iteration <= 3: go to step 2.
     e. Else: present the iteration-3 prompt verbatim (centralized in `gaia-val-validate` SKILL.md § "Auto-Fix Loop Pattern") and dispatch.

YOLO INVARIANT: the iteration-3 prompt MUST NOT be auto-answered under YOLO. This wire-in does not introduce a YOLO bypass branch. See ADR-057 FR-YOLO-2(e) and ADR-058 for the hard-gate contract.

> Val auto-review per E44-S2 pattern (ADR-058, architecture.md §10.31.2). The `product-brief` artifact_type uses Val's factual-claim validation against ground-truth plus the document-ruleset for product briefs (per E44-S1).

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-product-brief 9 product_name="$PRODUCT_NAME" target_user="$TARGET_USER" stage=val-auto-review --paths docs/creative-artifacts/product-brief-${SLUG}.md`

## Validation

<!--
  E42-S5 — V1→V2 27-item checklist port (FR-341, FR-359).
  Classification (27 items total):
    - Script-verifiable: 18 (SV-01..SV-18) — enforced by finalize.sh.
    - LLM-checkable:      9 (LLM-01..LLM-09) — evaluated by the host LLM
      against the product-brief artifact at finalize time.
  Exit code 0 when all 18 script-verifiable items PASS; non-zero otherwise.

  The 9 required product-brief sections (per architecture §10.31.1 and
  test plan §11.46.18 VCP-GATE-03) form the spine of the script-verifiable
  subset (SV-04..SV-12). SV-01..SV-03 guard artifact existence, non-empty
  body, and top-level title/frontmatter. SV-13..SV-18 are deeper presence
  checks — Vision body non-empty, ≥1 persona, ≥1 key feature, scope
  carries both in-scope and out-of-scope wording, ≥1 competitor, and
  Success Metrics contains at least one measurable numeric signal
  (percent, currency, duration, NPS). These defend against the most
  common V2-regression: a required heading present but the body left
  empty.

  LLM-checkable items (LLM-01..LLM-09) cover semantic judgement that
  bash cannot reliably assess — coherence, plausibility, rationale,
  credibility, differentiation, measurability, and scope discipline.

  Invoked by `finalize.sh` at post-complete (per §10.31.1).

  See docs/implementation-artifacts/E42-S5-port-gaia-product-brief-27-item-checklist-to-v2.md.

## Finalize

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-product-brief/scripts/finalize.sh

## Next Steps

- Primary: `/gaia-create-prd` — expand the brief into a full Product Requirements Document.
- Alternative: `/gaia-market-research` — if competitive landscape needs deeper validation before the PRD.
- Alternative: `/gaia-domain-research` — if domain context is still thin.
