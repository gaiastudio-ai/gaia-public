# review-nudge.bats — Cluster 9 unit test (E58-S3)
#
# Verifies the deterministic progressive-nudge renderer:
#   review-nudge.sh --story <key>
#
# Output contract (TC-RAR-07..10, ECI-672, AC-EC1..3):
#   - Block fenced with `--- Review Gate Nudge ---` (start + end)
#   - Part 1: Markdown Gate Status table (6 canonical rows in V1 order)
#   - Part 2: `Overall:` classification line
#       ALL PASSED | N FAILED | M UNVERIFIED
#   - Part 3: `Suggested next:` branch
#       ALL PASSED → /gaia-check-review-gate {key} + /gaia-check-dod {key}
#       ANY FAILED → list failed gates + /gaia-correct-course {key}
#       UNVERIFIED-only → per-gate commands from canonical map
#       MIXED → FAILED branch + `Also unrun:` line
#
# Advisory-only contract (AC4): exit 0 on all states (including malformed
# gate state). Story-key validation rejects non-canonical keys before any
# read (AC-EC2) — that is the ONE exception to the always-exit-0 rule and
# is enforced before any side effect.
