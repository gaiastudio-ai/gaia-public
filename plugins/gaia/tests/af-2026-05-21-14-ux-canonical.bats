# Regression coverage for AF-2026-05-21-14: the UX cluster pair (gaia-create-ux
# + gaia-edit-ux) hardcoded legacy docs/planning-artifacts/ paths in SKILL.md
# prose. Hybrid pattern: gaia-create-ux/scripts/finalize.sh already implements
# E96-S7 canonical-first two-tier (no edit needed; assert intact);
# gaia-edit-ux/scripts/setup.sh had bare legacy default (three-tier idiom
# applied per AF-21-10/-11/-12 pattern).
