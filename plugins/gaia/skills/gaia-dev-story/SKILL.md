## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/setup.sh

## Mission

You are implementing a user story end-to-end: loading the story spec, planning the implementation, writing tests (TDD red), implementing code (TDD green), refactoring, verifying the Definition of Done, committing, pushing, creating a PR, waiting for CI, and merging. This is the most comprehensive dev workflow in GAIA.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy dev-story workflow (brief Cluster 7, story E28-S53). The playbook contains all LLM reasoning guidance. The scripts directory contains all mechanical operations. The PostToolUse hook automatically writes a checkpoint after every Edit or Write tool invocation.

## Critical Rules

- A story file MUST exist at `docs/implementation-artifacts/{story_key}-*.md` before starting. If missing, fail fast with "Story file not found -- run /gaia-create-story first."
- Story status MUST be `ready-for-dev` or `in-progress`. Any other status is a HALT condition.
- Follow TDD cycle strictly: Red (failing tests) -> Green (minimal implementation) -> Refactor. Each phase is a separate step -- NEVER combine them.
- Do NOT write implementation code during the Red phase.
- Do NOT skip the Refactor phase even if Green code looks acceptable.
- All tests MUST pass before marking complete.
- Definition of Done checklist MUST be verified -- every item checked before moving to review.
- When reading or running application source code, use the project path as the base directory.
- All mechanical operations (git, checkpoint, sprint-state, sha256, PR, CI, merge) are handled by scripts -- do NOT inline shell commands in the conversation.
- The PostToolUse hook fires `checkpoint.sh` automatically after every Edit/Write -- you do not need to manually checkpoint file mutations.

## Steps

### Step 1 -- Load Story

- Parse the story key from the argument (e.g., `/gaia-dev-story E1-S2`).
- Run `scripts/load-story.sh {story_key}` to locate and validate the story file.

<!-- E57-S8: step1 script-wiring begin -->
After `load-story.sh` resolves the absolute story path, drive frontmatter parsing,
mode detection, and dependency-readiness through the deterministic helper scripts —
the LLM no longer parses the YAML frontmatter or computes the FRESH/REWORK/RESUME
verdict inline (per ADR-057, ADR-073, AF-2026-04-28-6).

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/story-parse.sh {story_path}`
  and `eval` its stdout to populate the canonical 10-variable env-var contract
  (`STORY_KEY`, `STATUS`, `RISK`, `EPIC_KEY`, `TYPE`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `SUBTASK_COUNT`,
  `SUBTASK_CHECKED`, `AC_COUNT`, `STORY_PATH`). Exit 2 = malformed frontmatter; HALT
  with the script's stderr.
- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/detect-mode.sh {story_path}`.
  Stdout is exactly one of `FRESH | REWORK | RESUME` — capture it as the execution
  mode. Do NOT re-derive the mode from `$STATUS` inline; the script is the single
  source of truth (per FR-DSS-1, FR-DSS-2).
- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/check-deps.sh {story_path}`.
  Exit 0 = all `depends_on:` stories are status `done`; exit 1 = at least one dep is
  not done (stderr lists `<KEY>: <STATUS>`); exit 2 = at least one dep file is missing
  on disk. HALT on exit 1 or 2 — surface stderr to the user before proceeding.

**Narrative Fallback (deprecated v1.131.x → v1.132.0):**
For brownfield projects on a stale plugin where these scripts are not yet present,
fall back to the legacy LLM narrative path. Each fallback is gated on the absence
of the new script:

```
if ! command -v story-parse.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # legacy narrative: read frontmatter inline, derive mode from $STATUS
else
  # new script path (above)
fi
```

This fallback is retained for ONE minor version (v1.131.x → v1.132.0) so brownfield
users with stale plugins do not break mid-upgrade. It will be removed in v1.132.0.
<!-- E57-S8: step1 script-wiring end -->

### Step 2 -- Update Status

- For FRESH mode: run `scripts/update-story-status.sh {story_key} in-progress`.
- For REWORK/RESUME: skip -- story is already in-progress.

<!-- E55-S5: step 2b atdd gate begin -->
### Step 2b -- ATDD Gate (high-risk stories only)

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/atdd-gate.sh {story_key}`.
- The script reads the story's `risk` frontmatter field (canonical) — `risk_level` is a PRD/ADR longhand alias for the same semantic field. If `risk: high`, the script requires at least one ATDD scenarios file matching `atdd-{epic_key}*.md` OR `atdd-{story_key}*.md` under `docs/test-artifacts/`. For `medium`, `low`, or unset risk it exits 0 unconditionally.
- On non-zero exit (high-risk story, no ATDD file): HALT with the script's stderr message naming the expected paths under `docs/test-artifacts/`. Direct the user to `/gaia-atdd {story_key}` to generate the scenarios file before re-running `/gaia-dev-story`.
- On exit 0: proceed to Step 3.
- **Sequencing trade-off:** Step 2b sits AFTER Step 2 (status is already `in-progress`) but BEFORE Step 3 (no feature branch yet). Halting at 2b leaves the story status updated but no branch created — the user reverts status manually (or re-runs /gaia-dev-story after producing the ATDD file) to recover.
<!-- E55-S5: step 2b atdd gate end -->

### Step 3 -- Create Feature Branch

- Run `scripts/git-branch.sh {story_key} {slug}` to create a feature branch.
- The script handles collision detection and offers resume if branch exists.

### Step 4 -- Plan Implementation

- Load the playbook: read `playbook.md` for reasoning guidance.
- For FRESH mode: read architecture.md and ux-design.md for context. Generate a detailed implementation plan covering: context, implementation steps, files to modify, testing strategy, risks.
- For REWORK mode: read failed review reports. Focus plan on fixing review issues.
- For RESUME mode: continue from checkpoint state.
- Render the plan to the user.

<!-- E55-S5: figma graceful-degrade begin -->
**Figma graceful-degrade (FR-DSH-8):** Before rendering the plan, if the story frontmatter has a `figma:` block, probe the Figma MCP server (e.g., `mcp__claude_ai_Figma__whoami`). If the probe fails (server unavailable, auth error, timeout, or the server is not listed):

- Log a single-line warning to stderr: `figma_mcp_unavailable: server={name} fallback=text-only` (NFR-DSH-5 single-line gate-log convention).
- Proceed with text-only context — DO NOT halt, no exception. Plan rendering continues with whatever non-Figma context is available.

Stories without a `figma:` frontmatter block proceed unchanged — this region only fires when Figma context was requested.
<!-- E55-S5: figma graceful-degrade end -->

<!-- E55-S1: planning gate begin -->
<!-- E55-S5: plan-structure validator hook (added by E55-S5) -->

**Plan-structure validator (FR-DSH-4):** BEFORE the planning gate halt fires (E55-S1) and BEFORE the YOLO auto-validation loop (E55-S2), run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/validate-plan-structure.sh` against the rendered plan. Pass `--rework` when the execution mode is REWORK so the `Root Cause` section is required; otherwise the script enforces 8 sections (REWORK-only `Root Cause` skipped).

- The validator reports the FIRST missing canonical section on stderr and exits non-zero. Do NOT advance to the gate halt or the YOLO branch until the validator passes (TC-DSH-10).
- On non-zero exit: log the missing section, instruct the agent to regenerate the plan with the missing section included, then re-run the validator.
- Cap the regenerate loop at 5 attempts to avoid infinite agent loops on a structurally broken plan template. On cap exhaustion, HALT with the last validator stderr and the attempt count so the user can intervene before the gate fires.
- T-38 mitigation: the validator uses `grep -F` with literal ASCII section names — Cyrillic homoglyphs (e.g., `Сontext` U+0421) are correctly treated as MISSING.

After the plan is rendered, the planning gate halts the workflow. YOLO mode detection is the single source of truth that selects the branch -- never re-implement detection inline (per ADR-057, ADR-073).

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/yolo-mode.sh is_yolo` to detect YOLO mode. The exit status is the verdict (0 = YOLO active, non-zero = interactive).

If `is_yolo` returns non-zero (non-YOLO branch -- default):
  - The next tool invocation MUST be `AskUserQuestion`. Do NOT invoke any other tool first. In particular, do NOT issue any `Edit` or `Write` tool call to a test file or implementation file between the plan render and the user's response -- the plan the user sees is the plan that gets implemented.
  <!-- E55-S3: three-option prompt body (labels: approve, revise, validate) -->
  - The `AskUserQuestion` prompt body offers exactly three labeled options -- `approve`, `revise`, `validate` -- lowercase, no punctuation, no synonyms. Match TC-DSH-02 expectations exactly. Do NOT add a fourth option (no `skip`, `verify`, `cancel`, etc.).
  - On `approve`: advance to Step 5 TDD Red. Only an explicit `approve` response advances; any other response (including silence) keeps the workflow halted (preserves E55-S1 behavior).
  - On `revise`: ask the user for free-form feedback text via a follow-up `AskUserQuestion` (or harness-equivalent). Pass the feedback to the plan regenerator and regenerate the plan reflecting the feedback. Then re-ask the same three-option question. The `revise` loop is user-driven and unbounded -- there is NO iteration cap; the user decides when to `approve` (TC-DSH-03).
  - On `validate`: route the rendered plan to the `gaia-val-validate` skill via Skill-to-Skill delegation with `context: fork`. Render Val's findings inline, grouped into CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO buckets. Then re-ask the same three-option question. The `validate` loop is user-driven and unbounded -- there is NO iteration cap; the user decides when to `approve` or `revise` (TC-DSH-04). This is intentionally distinct from the YOLO branch's 3-iteration auto-fix cap (E55-S2 / FR-340).
  - Emit a single-line gate log to stderr (NFR-DSH-5): `step4_gate: yolo=false verdict=halted` on entry, then `step4_gate: yolo=false verdict=passed` once the user responds with `approve`. Emit `step4_gate: yolo=false verdict=revise` and `step4_gate: yolo=false verdict=validate` per loop iteration on the corresponding branch.

If `is_yolo` returns zero (YOLO branch):
  <!-- E55-S2: YOLO Val auto-validation loop (added by E55-S2) -->
  - The rendered plan auto-routes to Val for up to 3 iterations of CRITICAL+WARNING auto-fix per ADR-073. The YOLO branch MUST NOT issue any user-prompt tool call; the next tool invocation MUST be the `gaia-val-validate` skill on the rendered plan with `context: fork`. Auto-fix is inline using this skill's own `Edit`/`Write` tools (NFR-046 single-spawn-level) — no nested subagent spawn inside the loop.
  - **T-37 path-traversal mitigation (AC5):** BEFORE constructing the audit-file path, validate `story_key` against the regex `^E[0-9]+-S[0-9]+$`. On mismatch, abort the YOLO branch with a clear error and emit no writes — never sanitize-and-continue. Reference shell idiom: `printf '%s\n' "$story_key" | grep -Eq '^E[0-9]+-S[0-9]+$'`.
  - **Audit file (AC2):** persist findings to `_memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-yolo-plan-findings.md` on every iteration. Append per iteration — never overwrite, never truncate. Two consecutive YOLO runs on the same story append a fresh set of `## Iteration {N} — {timestamp}` sections under the existing ones; entries from prior runs MUST be preserved verbatim. Each section body is the structured findings JSON or YAML returned by Val.
  - **Checkpoint persistence (AC4):** record the YOLO flag, the current iteration count, and the `last-findings-hash` (sha256 of the latest findings JSON) via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/append-val-iteration.sh` (which delegates to `write-checkpoint.sh`). Comparing `last-findings-hash` across iterations identifies oscillation; log stalls to the Dev Agent Record but DO NOT short-circuit the loop — the 3-iteration cap is the hard backstop.
  - **ADR-073 canonical pseudocode (DoD documentation requirement):**

```
iteration = 0
while iteration < 3:
  findings = val.validate(plan)            # gaia-val-validate, severity in {CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO}
  critical = filter(findings, severity="CRITICAL")
  warning  = filter(findings, severity="WARNING")
  audit_append(iteration, findings)        # _memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-yolo-plan-findings.md
  checkpoint_record(yolo=true, iteration, sha256(findings))
  if not critical and not warning:         # INFO-only or empty -> break (AC3)
    break
  apply_fixes(critical + warning)          # inline Edit/Write — no subagent spawn
  iteration += 1
if iteration == 3 and (critical or warning):
  HALT with remaining findings + audit-file path -> /gaia-fix-story  # AC2 cap (FR-340)
else:
  proceed to Step 5
```

  - **Halt-on-exhaust behavior (AC2):** if the loop exhausts the 3-iteration cap with remaining CRITICAL or WARNING findings, HALT with an actionable message that names the remaining findings and points to `_memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-yolo-plan-findings.md`. Direct the user to `/gaia-fix-story` or to re-run with the audit file as context. YOLO MUST NOT bypass the cap (FR-340).
  - **INFO-only break (AC3):** if Val returns INFO-only findings (or no findings) on any iteration, break the loop and proceed to Step 5 immediately — INFO findings are advisory and never gating.
  - **Resume semantics (AC4):** when `/gaia-resume` re-enters this branch, read the checkpoint to recover yolo flag + iteration count + last-findings-hash, then re-enter the loop at the recorded iteration. If the next iteration's findings hash matches the recorded one, log the stall and continue.
  - **No inline YOLO detection (AC6):** YOLO detection has already happened at the gate dispatch above. This branch body MUST NOT redefine or re-implement YOLO detection — single-source-of-truth per ADR-057 / ADR-073. The branch is selected by the surrounding gate; the body simply consumes the verdict.
  - **Soft dependency on E41-S5 (`yolo_steps:` wiring):** if E41-S5 has landed, the per-step YOLO list selects this branch via the wired entry point; if not, this branch is reached via the script-call fallback at the gate dispatch above — never inline.
  - Emit a single-line gate log to stderr per iteration (NFR-DSH-5): `step4_gate: yolo=true iteration={N} outcome={clean|info_only|findings_present}` (the `outcome` enum mirrors `append-val-iteration.sh --revalidation-outcome`). On loop exit emit a terminal verdict: `step4_gate: yolo=true verdict=passed` when the loop broke on clean / info_only, or `step4_gate: yolo=true verdict=halted` when the 3-iteration cap was reached with remaining CRITICAL or WARNING findings.

Backward-compatibility note (NFR-DSH-3): a resumed in-progress story with no Step 4 gate-clearance record on the checkpoint is treated as "halt not yet presented" and re-issues the halt -- it does NOT silently advance to Step 5.

<!-- E55-S1: planning gate end -->

### Step 5 -- TDD Red Phase (Write Failing Tests)

- Follow the playbook's test strategy reasoning.
- For each subtask: write failing test(s) that define expected behavior.
- Run the test suite -- verify all new tests FAIL.
- Tests MUST fail because implementation does not exist yet. If a test passes without implementation, it is vacuous and must be rewritten.

### Step 5a -- TDD Review Gate (Red phase)

<!-- E57-S4: step5 tdd-review-gate begin -->
After Step 5 completes with all new tests failing, invoke the risk-gated TDD review hook. The gate is a deterministic SKIP / PROMPT / QA_AUTO decision driven by the story's `risk` frontmatter, the configured `dev_story.tdd_review.threshold` and `phases`, and YOLO mode (per ADR-067, ADR-057, ADR-073). The wiring is single-source-of-truth — never re-implement the decision matrix inline (FR-TDR-2).

This gate sits OUTSIDE the Step 5 TDD body so the pause-free TDD invariant (E55-S4 / TC-DSH-12) is preserved — the body of Step 5 itself contains no `AskUserQuestion` and no `HALT` directive.

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/tdd-review-gate.sh {story_key} red`. The script prints exactly one of `SKIP`, `PROMPT`, `QA_AUTO` on stdout; capture it as `decision`.
- **`SKIP`:** Continue silently to Step 6. NO `AskUserQuestion` is presented. Emit a single-line gate log to stderr (NFR-DSH-5): `step5_tdd_gate: phase=red verdict=skip`.
- **`PROMPT`:** The next tool invocation MUST be `AskUserQuestion`. The prompt body offers exactly three labeled options — verbatim labels `review-myself`, `route-to-qa`, `proceed-anyway` (case-sensitive, hyphen-sensitive, in that exact order, no synonyms, no fourth option). The question stem names the gate trigger (story risk, configured threshold, current phase = `red`).
  - On `review-myself`: HALT for user-driven review. Resume via `/gaia-resume` re-enters at this same gate point.
  - On `route-to-qa`: dispatch the `tdd-reviewer` subagent (`gaia-public/plugins/gaia/agents/tdd-reviewer.md`, persona "Tex") in fork context with the Red-phase diff. Surface the verdict per ADR-063 (PASSED / FAILED / UNVERIFIED + ADR-037 findings line-by-line for WARNING-only). HALT on any `severity: CRITICAL` finding per ADR-067 — YOLO MUST NOT auto-resolve CRITICAL findings; the halt fires in BOTH YOLO and non-YOLO. Findings persist to `_memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-tdd-review-findings.md` (append-only).
  - On `proceed-anyway`: record a timestamped decision in the dev-story checkpoint via the PostToolUse `checkpoint.sh` write hook — the entry MUST include the timestamp (UTC ISO-8601), the phase (`red`), and the free-form reason captured from the user. Continue to Step 6.
  - Emit `step5_tdd_gate: phase=red verdict=prompt choice={review-myself|route-to-qa|proceed-anyway}` to stderr.
- **`QA_AUTO`:** YOLO + `qa_auto_in_yolo=true` branch. Dispatch the `tdd-reviewer` subagent with the same payload as `route-to-qa` (the only difference is the user did not explicitly choose). Surface the verdict per ADR-063; HALT on CRITICAL per ADR-067 in BOTH modes. Emit `step5_tdd_gate: phase=red verdict=qa_auto`.

The hook fires exactly once per Step 5. If the gate returns `SKIP`, no subagent is dispatched and no prompt is presented.
<!-- E57-S4: step5 tdd-review-gate end -->

### Step 6 -- TDD Green Phase (Implement to Pass)

- Follow the playbook's design approach reasoning.
- For each subtask: implement minimum code to make failing tests pass.
- Run the test suite -- verify all tests PASS.
- Mark each completed subtask in the story file.

### Step 6a -- TDD Review Gate (Green phase)

<!-- E57-S4: step6 tdd-review-gate begin -->
After Step 6 completes with all tests green, invoke the risk-gated TDD review hook. Decision matrix and dispatch contract mirror Step 5a — the only difference is `phase=green` (per ADR-067, ADR-057, ADR-073, FR-TDR-2).

This gate sits OUTSIDE the Step 6 TDD body so the pause-free TDD invariant (E55-S4 / TC-DSH-12) is preserved — the body of Step 6 itself contains no `AskUserQuestion` and no `HALT` directive.

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/tdd-review-gate.sh {story_key} green`. Capture stdout as `decision`.
- **`SKIP`:** Continue silently to Step 6b. NO `AskUserQuestion`. Emit `step6_tdd_gate: phase=green verdict=skip`.
- **`PROMPT`:** Next tool invocation MUST be `AskUserQuestion` with the three verbatim labels — `review-myself`, `route-to-qa`, `proceed-anyway` (case-sensitive, hyphen-sensitive, in that order, no fourth option).
  - On `review-myself`: HALT for user-driven review; `/gaia-resume` re-enters at this gate point.
  - On `route-to-qa`: dispatch the `tdd-reviewer` subagent in fork context with the Green-phase diff. Surface the verdict per ADR-063 (line-by-line for WARNING-only). HALT on `severity: CRITICAL` per ADR-067 in BOTH YOLO and non-YOLO. Findings append to `_memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-tdd-review-findings.md`.
  - On `proceed-anyway`: record a timestamped decision (UTC ISO-8601 + phase=`green` + reason) in the dev-story checkpoint via the PostToolUse `checkpoint.sh` write hook. Continue to Step 6b.
  - Emit `step6_tdd_gate: phase=green verdict=prompt choice={review-myself|route-to-qa|proceed-anyway}`.
- **`QA_AUTO`:** Dispatch the `tdd-reviewer` subagent with the same payload as `route-to-qa`. Surface the verdict per ADR-063; HALT on CRITICAL per ADR-067 in BOTH modes. Emit `step6_tdd_gate: phase=green verdict=qa_auto`.

The hook fires exactly once per Step 6 and ALWAYS BEFORE Step 6b advisory hints.
<!-- E57-S4: step6 tdd-review-gate end -->

<!-- E55-S7: step 6b begin -->
### Step 6b -- Conditional Check Advisory Hints (FR-DSH-9)

After Step 6 Green completes with all tests passing, run a single advisory pass over the staged diff to surface change patterns that commonly carry hidden risk. Step 6b is PURELY ADVISORY — it MUST NOT halt the workflow under any condition. The agent reads the advisory output and either addresses each item within the current story or captures it as a Finding, then proceeds to Step 7 Refactor.

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/conditional-check-hints.sh` against the staged diff. The helper reads `git diff --cached --name-only` and emits one advisory line per matched category. Exit code is ALWAYS 0.
- The helper checks three patterns and emits AT MOST one advisory line per category (advisory output is informational; never multiple per category):
  1. **API route changes** — any path matching `*/routes/*.{ts,py,go}` OR `*/api/*.{ts,py,go}` triggers a contract-test advisory.
  2. **Schema/migration changes** — any path matching `*/migrations/*.sql` OR a filename containing `schema` with extension `.ts` / `.py` / `.sql` triggers a migration-script verification advisory.
  3. **Large blast radius** — total staged file count >= `BLAST_RADIUS_THRESHOLD` (default 10) triggers a feature-flag candidacy advisory.
- The advisories run in BOTH YOLO and non-YOLO modes — there is no `is_yolo` gate at Step 6b. The same staged set produces identical output regardless of run mode (distinct from E55-S2 / E55-S8 which are YOLO-gated).
- Each advisory line lists at most 10 file paths; longer lists are truncated with a trailing `,...`. This avoids advisory spam when many files in the same category change.
- **Non-halting contract:** Step 6b MUST NOT halt the workflow. The skill always proceeds to Step 7 Refactor after the advisory pass — even when all three advisories fire.
- Emit a single-line gate log to stderr (NFR-DSH-5): `step6b_gate: advisories={count}` where `count` is the number of advisory lines emitted (0, 1, 2, or 3).
<!-- E55-S7: step 6b end -->

### Step 7 -- TDD Refactor Phase

- Improve code quality while keeping all tests green.
- Extract shared utilities, decompose large functions, improve naming, remove duplication.
- Run the test suite -- verify all tests STILL PASS.

### Step 7a -- TDD Review Gate (Refactor phase)

<!-- E57-S4: step7 tdd-review-gate begin -->
After Step 7 completes with all tests still green, invoke the risk-gated TDD review hook. Decision matrix and dispatch contract mirror Steps 5a and 6a — the only difference is `phase=refactor` (per ADR-067, ADR-057, ADR-073, FR-TDR-2).

This gate sits OUTSIDE the Step 7 TDD body so the pause-free TDD invariant (E55-S4 / TC-DSH-12) is preserved — the body of Step 7 itself contains no `AskUserQuestion` and no `HALT` directive.

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/tdd-review-gate.sh {story_key} refactor`. Capture stdout as `decision`.
- **`SKIP`:** Continue silently to Step 7b. NO `AskUserQuestion`. Emit `step7_tdd_gate: phase=refactor verdict=skip`.
- **`PROMPT`:** Next tool invocation MUST be `AskUserQuestion` with the three verbatim labels — `review-myself`, `route-to-qa`, `proceed-anyway` (case-sensitive, hyphen-sensitive, in that order, no fourth option).
  - On `review-myself`: HALT for user-driven review; `/gaia-resume` re-enters at this gate point.
  - On `route-to-qa`: dispatch the `tdd-reviewer` subagent in fork context with the Refactor-phase diff. Surface the verdict per ADR-063 (line-by-line for WARNING-only). HALT on `severity: CRITICAL` per ADR-067 in BOTH YOLO and non-YOLO. Findings append to `_memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-tdd-review-findings.md`.
  - On `proceed-anyway`: record a timestamped decision (UTC ISO-8601 + phase=`refactor` + reason) in the dev-story checkpoint via the PostToolUse `checkpoint.sh` write hook. Continue to Step 7b.
  - Emit `step7_tdd_gate: phase=refactor verdict=prompt choice={review-myself|route-to-qa|proceed-anyway}`.
- **`QA_AUTO`:** Dispatch the `tdd-reviewer` subagent with the same payload as `route-to-qa`. Surface the verdict per ADR-063; HALT on CRITICAL per ADR-067 in BOTH modes. Emit `step7_tdd_gate: phase=refactor verdict=qa_auto`.

The hook fires exactly once per Step 7 and ALWAYS BEFORE Step 7b Val-in-TDD pass.
<!-- E57-S4: step7 tdd-review-gate end -->

<!-- E55-S4: step 7b begin -->
### Step 7b -- Val-in-TDD single post-Refactor pass (ADR-073)

After Step 7 Refactor completes with all tests green, run a SINGLE Val pass over the diff (artifacts touched during Steps 5-7) before moving on to Step 8 Capture Findings. This restores V1's Val-in-TDD capability without re-introducing per-phase pauses inside the TDD body — Steps 5/6/7 remain pause-free per the contract enforced by `tests/skills/gaia-dev-story-step7b-val.bats`.

This loop runs unconditionally — both YOLO and non-YOLO. There is NO YOLO-mode gate at Step 7b; YOLO-mode detection lives only at the Step 4 planning gate (ADR-057, ADR-073). The body MUST NOT redefine or re-implement YOLO-mode detection — single-source-of-truth.

Loop semantics mirror E55-S2 (planning-gate YOLO loop): 3-iteration cap, CRITICAL+WARNING gating, INFO-only break, audit-file append, HALT-on-exhaustion. The differences from E55-S2 are the input (TDD diff vs. plan) and the audit-file name (`{story_key}-tdd-val-findings.md` vs. `{story_key}-yolo-plan-findings.md`).

- The next tool invocation MUST be the `gaia-val-validate` skill on the diff (artifacts touched during Steps 5-7) with `context: fork`. Auto-fix is inline using this skill's own `Edit`/`Write` tools (NFR-046 single-spawn-level) — no nested subagent spawn inside the loop.
- **T-37 path-traversal mitigation:** BEFORE constructing the audit-file path, validate `story_key` against the regex `^E[0-9]+-S[0-9]+$`. On mismatch, abort Step 7b with a clear error and emit no writes — never sanitize-and-continue. Reference shell idiom: `printf '%s\n' "$story_key" | grep -Eq '^E[0-9]+-S[0-9]+$'`. The regex check MUST run before any path is constructed and before any audit-file write.
- **Audit file:** persist findings to `_memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-tdd-val-findings.md` on every iteration. Append per iteration — never overwrite, never truncate. Two consecutive end-of-story runs append a fresh set of `## Iteration {N} — {timestamp}` sections under the existing ones; entries from prior runs MUST be preserved verbatim. Each section body is the structured findings JSON or YAML returned by Val.
- **Auto-fix vocabulary** for diff-level findings: line edits, function-signature corrections, missing test assertions, dead code removal. Anything beyond the diff (e.g., cross-cutting refactors) is logged as Dev Notes and deferred — auto-fix MUST stay scoped to the diff.
- **ADR-073 canonical pseudocode (DoD documentation requirement):**

```
diff = gather_diff(steps=[5,6,7])
iteration = 0
while iteration < 3:
  findings = val.validate(diff)              # gaia-val-validate, severity in {CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO}
  critical = filter(findings, severity="CRITICAL")
  warning  = filter(findings, severity="WARNING")
  audit_append(iteration, findings)          # _memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-tdd-val-findings.md
  if not critical and not warning:           # INFO-only or empty -> break
    break
  apply_fixes(critical + warning)            # inline Edit/Write — no subagent spawn
  iteration += 1
if iteration == 3 and (critical or warning):
  HALT with remaining findings + audit-file path
else:
  proceed to Step 8 (Capture Findings)
```

- **Halt-on-exhaust behavior (AC2):** if the loop exhausts the 3-iteration cap with remaining CRITICAL or WARNING findings, HALT with an actionable message that names the remaining findings and points to `_memory/checkpoints/{story_key}-tdd-val-findings.md`. Direct the user to `/gaia-fix-story` or to re-run with the audit file as context. The 3-iteration cap MUST NOT be bypassed.
- **INFO-only break:** if Val returns INFO-only findings (or no findings) on any iteration, break the loop and proceed to Step 8 immediately — INFO findings are advisory and never gating.
- **Single Val pass per story:** Step 7b runs Val ONCE per story-end, not once per Refactor cycle. Multiple Refactor iterations within Step 7 are part of the TDD body — they do NOT each trigger a Val pass.
- Emit a single-line gate log to stderr per iteration (NFR-DSH-5): `step7b_gate: iteration={N} outcome={clean|info_only|findings_present}`. On loop exit emit a terminal verdict: `step7b_gate: verdict=passed` when the loop broke on clean / info_only, or `step7b_gate: verdict=halted` when the 3-iteration cap was reached with remaining CRITICAL or WARNING findings.
<!-- E55-S4: step 7b end -->

### Step 8 -- Capture Findings

- Review any out-of-scope issues discovered during implementation.
- Add findings to the story file's Findings table.

<!-- E55-S8: step 9 dod-check wire begin -->
### Step 9 -- Definition of Done

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/dod-check.sh` (export `STORY_FILE` to the absolute story path so the subtask check fires). The script runs build / tests / lint / secrets / subtask checks and emits one YAML row per check: `- { item: <name>, status: PASSED|FAILED, output: <captured output> }`. Exit 0 = all PASSED; non-zero = at least one FAILED.
- Parse the YAML output and render a human-readable summary; per FR-DSH-10 the helper script holds the deterministic mechanics — DO NOT re-implement build/test/lint/secrets/subtask checks inline in this skill.
- On any FAILED row: auto-fix the underlying issue (test failure, lint warning, staged secret, unchecked subtask) and re-run `dod-check.sh`. Cap at 3 auto-fix iterations; on cap exhaustion, HALT with the failing rows and direct the user to intervene.
- ACs met / docs updated remain LLM-evaluated since they are intent-level checks, not script-checkable.
<!-- E55-S8: step 9 dod-check wire end -->

<!-- E55-S8: step 10 git-push wire begin -->
### Step 10 -- Commit and Push

<!-- E57-S8: step10 script-wiring begin -->
At the top of the CI section — before any commit / push action — the orchestrator
MUST consult the deterministic promotion-chain guard. This replaces the LLM
narrative that previously inferred CI configuration inline (per ADR-057, ADR-073,
AF-2026-04-28-6, FR-DSS-3).

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/promotion-chain-guard.sh`.
  Exit 0 = `PRESENT:<branch>` on stdout (the resolved first promotion-chain branch);
  exit 1 = `ABSENT` (stderr names the missing config and points to `/gaia-ci-edit`).
  On `ABSENT`, Steps 10–13 (push, PR, CI, merge) MUST be skipped — the story can
  still complete locally but the promotion gates do not fire. On `PRESENT`, capture
  the branch as `$PR_BASE` for use by `pr-create.sh --base`.
- For commit-message construction, run
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/commit-msg.sh {story_path}`
  and feed its stdout to `git commit -F -`. Do NOT compose Conventional Commit
  subject lines inline — `commit-msg.sh` is the single source of truth (per
  FR-DSS-5, FR-DSS-6, NFR-DSS-1). The script enforces the
  `<type>(<story_key>): <title>` schema and the no-`Claude` / no-`AI` /
  no-`Co-Authored-By` policy from CLAUDE.md.

**Narrative Fallback (deprecated v1.131.x → v1.132.0):**
For brownfield projects on a stale plugin where these scripts are not yet present,
fall back to the legacy LLM narrative path:

```
if ! command -v promotion-chain-guard.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # legacy narrative: infer CI config from project-config.yaml inline
fi
if ! command -v commit-msg.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # legacy narrative: compose Conventional Commit subject inline
fi
```

This fallback is retained for ONE minor version (v1.131.x → v1.132.0) so brownfield
users with stale plugins do not break mid-upgrade. It will be removed in v1.132.0.
<!-- E57-S8: step10 script-wiring end -->

- Run `scripts/git-branch.sh` to verify branch state.
- Stage and commit with conventional commit format.
- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/git-push.sh` to push the current branch to `origin`. The shared helper (a) refuses to push from `main` / `staging` (delegating to `lib/dev-story-security-invariants.sh::assert_branch_not_protected` from E55-S6 when present), (b) retries ONCE on transient network errors (e.g., `Could not resolve host`, `Operation timed out`) with a 5-second backoff, and (c) fails LOUDLY on auth / permission errors with no retry. DO NOT inline `git push` here — the helper is the single source of truth.
- Run `scripts/update-story-status.sh {story_key} review` after all gates pass.
<!-- E55-S8: step 10 git-push wire end -->

### Step 11 -- Create PR

<!-- E57-S8: step11 script-wiring begin -->
The PR body is sourced from `pr-body.sh` — the LLM no longer composes the body
inline (per ADR-057, ADR-073, AF-2026-04-28-6, FR-DSS-5, FR-DSS-6).

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/pr-body.sh {story_path}`
  and capture stdout as `$PR_BODY`. The script emits exactly four canonical
  Markdown sections in order: Acceptance Criteria, Definition of Done, Diff Stat,
  Story-link.
- Then invoke `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/pr-create.sh
  {story_key} {title} --body-file <(printf '%s\n' "$PR_BODY")` (or pipe `$PR_BODY`
  via the helper's body-file convention) so that `pr-create.sh` consumes the
  pre-rendered body rather than constructing one inline. Do NOT hand-craft the PR
  body in chat — `pr-body.sh` is the single source of truth.

**Narrative Fallback (deprecated v1.131.x → v1.132.0):**
For brownfield projects on a stale plugin where `pr-body.sh` is not yet present,
fall back to the legacy LLM narrative path:

```
if ! command -v pr-body.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # legacy narrative: pr-create.sh composes a default body from $STORY_KEY
fi
```

This fallback is retained for ONE minor version (v1.131.x → v1.132.0) so brownfield
users with stale plugins do not break mid-upgrade. It will be removed in v1.132.0.
<!-- E57-S8: step11 script-wiring end -->

- `pr-create.sh` targets the first promotion chain environment as resolved by `promotion-chain-guard.sh` in Step 10.

### Step 12 -- Wait for CI

- Run `scripts/ci-wait.sh {pr_number}` to poll CI status.
- The script handles timeout, transient errors, and failure reporting.

### Step 13 -- Merge PR

- Run `scripts/merge.sh {pr_number} {story_key}` to merge the PR.
- The script handles conflict detection, branch protection, and strategy selection.

### Step 14 -- Post-Completion Gate

- After the dev-story subagent returns `status=done`, the orchestrator verifies that a merge commit containing the story key actually exists on the target branch before accepting the done transition.
- Run `scripts/verify-pr-merged.sh {story_key} {target_branch}` where `{target_branch}` is derived from `ci_cd.promotion_chain[0].branch` in global.yaml.
- If no promotion chain is configured, pass `--no-chain` instead of a branch name. The script exits 3 (skip) and the gate passes silently for backward compatibility.
- **Exit code 0 (pass):** Merge commit found on target branch. Proceed to Step 15.
- **Exit code 2 (fail):** No merge commit found. The orchestrator re-runs Steps 10-13 (commit, push, create PR, wait for CI, merge) in the main orchestrator context before advancing the story to done. This handles the case where the subagent completed implementation but failed to push or merge.
- **Word-boundary matching:** The script uses `\b{story_key}\b` grep patterns to avoid false positives on partial key matches (e.g., E20-S1 must not match E20-S19). Matching is case-insensitive to handle squash-merge message rewrites.
- **Historical failure modes that motivated this gate:**
  - **E17-S1 (sprint-17):** Dev-story subagent completed implementation but never pushed commits. Orchestrator accepted `status=done` at face value. Sprint closed with unmerged code.
  - **E28-S213 (sprint-25):** Dev-story subagent completed all reviews but skipped push/PR/merge steps. Same outcome -- orchestrator trusted the status and sprint closed without the code landing.

<!-- E55-S8: step 15 init-review-gate wire begin -->
### Step 15 -- Update Review Gate

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-dev-story/scripts/init-review-gate.sh {story_file}` to seed (or replace) the Review Gate table with the canonical 6-row UNVERIFIED block. The helper is idempotent — re-running on a story file that already has the block yields a byte-identical result.
- Update story status to `review` via `scripts/update-story-status.sh {story_key} review`.
<!-- E55-S8: step 15 init-review-gate wire end -->

<!-- E55-S8: step 16 begin -->
### Step 16 -- Auto-Reviews (YOLO-only)

YOLO-gated invocation of the six reviews that populate the Review Gate. Non-YOLO runs MUST NOT auto-fire reviews — the user manually invokes each review from the Review Gate UNVERIFIED rows. Forbidden by ADR-073: silently auto-firing reviews in non-YOLO would erase user oversight.

- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/yolo-mode.sh is_yolo` to detect YOLO mode (single source of truth — never re-implement detection inline per ADR-057 / ADR-073).

- If `is_yolo` returns non-zero (non-YOLO branch — default):
  - SKIP Step 16 entirely. Review Gate rows remain UNVERIFIED for manual user review.
  - Emit a single-line gate log to stderr (NFR-DSH-5): `step16_gate: yolo=false verdict=skipped`.
  - Proceed to skill end.

- If `is_yolo` returns zero (YOLO branch):
  - Invoke `gaia-run-all-reviews` via Skill-to-Skill delegation. The aggregator runs all six reviews (Code Review, QA Tests, Security Review, Test Automation, Test Review, Performance Review) sequentially in subagents.
  - Each review writes its verdict (PASSED / FAILED) into the matching Review Gate row via `review-gate.sh`. After the aggregator completes, the Review Gate table is fully populated — no row remains UNVERIFIED.
  - Emit `step16_gate: yolo=true verdict=invoked` on entry and `step16_gate: yolo=true verdict=complete` on aggregator return.

- **Sequencing invariant (AC4):** Step 14 (post-completion gate, E20-S19) MUST run BEFORE Step 16. Step 16 NEVER precedes Step 14. The skill ordering above enforces this — Step 14's begin marker precedes Step 16's begin marker.
