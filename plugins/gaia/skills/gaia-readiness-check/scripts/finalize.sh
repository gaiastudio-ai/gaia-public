# finalize.sh — /gaia-readiness-check skill finalize (E28-S48 + E42-S13)
#
# E42-S13 extends the bare-bones Cluster 6 finalize scaffolding with a
# 65-item post-completion checklist (25 script-verifiable + 40
# LLM-checkable) derived from the V1 implementation-readiness checklist
# plus the reconciled items from the gap analysis (§14
# /gaia-readiness-check).
# See docs/implementation-artifacts/E42-S13-* for the V1 -> V2 mapping.
#
# Responsibilities (per brief §Cluster 6 + story E42-S13):
#   1. Run the script-verifiable subset of the 65 V1 checklist items
#      against the readiness-report.md artifact. Validation runs
#      FIRST (before checkpoint/lifecycle-event — AC-EC6 ordering).
#   2. Emit an LLM-checkable payload listing the semantic-judgment items.
#   3. Write a checkpoint via the shared checkpoint.sh helper.
#   4. Emit a lifecycle event via lifecycle-event.sh.
#
# The observability side effects (3 + 4) MUST run on every invocation —
# the checklist outcome never suppresses the checkpoint/event write
# (matches E42-S1..S12 contract; story AC5).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — finalize succeeded; all 25 script-verifiable items PASS (or
#       no artifact was requested — classic Cluster 6 behaviour).
#   1 — one or more script-verifiable checklist items FAIL; the
#       AC4 "no readiness report to validate" violation; or a
#       checkpoint/lifecycle-event failure. Failed item names are
#       listed on stderr under a "Checklist violations:" header
#       followed by a one-line remediation hint (AC2).
#
# Environment:
#   READINESS_ARTIFACT    Absolute path to the readiness-report artifact
#                         to validate. When set, the script runs the
#                         65-item checklist against it. When set but
#                         the file does not exist or is empty, AC4
#                         fires — a single "no readiness report to
#                         validate" violation is emitted and the script
#                         exits non-zero. When unset, the script looks
#                         for docs/planning-artifacts/readiness-report.md
#                         relative to the current working directory.
#                         If neither is present, the checklist run is
#                         skipped (classic Cluster 6 behaviour —
#                         observability still runs, exit 0).
#   PROJECT_ROOT          Optional. Root path used to resolve upstream
#                         artifact presence checks (PRD, architecture,
#                         test-plan, etc.). Defaults to the current
#                         working directory.
