#!/usr/bin/env bash
# manual-test-review-dispatch.sh — per-story manual-test dispatch for the
# run-all-reviews (gaia-review-all) flow.
#
# The manual-test machinery (surface dispatch + run-record + the review-gate
# `manual-test` ledger gate + the advisory/gating consumer in
# transition-story-status.sh) all exist, but NOTHING in the per-story review
# flow ever dispatched a surface to PRODUCE a manual-test verdict. So a story
# with `manual_verification: true` reached `done` with an empty manual-test
# ledger entry — the advisory/gating gate had no verdict to act on, and a
# silently-broken (404/unwired) feature shipped green.
#
# This helper closes that gap: for a story whose frontmatter declares
# `manual_verification: true`, it dispatches the functional manual-test surface
# (reusing dispatch-surface.sh — it does NOT reimplement surface logic) and
# records the resulting verdict to the review-gate `manual-test` ledger gate
# (via review-gate.sh --plan-id). For a story that does not opt in, it is a
# clean no-op (exit 0, nothing recorded) so the common case is unaffected.
#
# Invocation:
#   manual-test-review-dispatch.sh --story <key> [--config <path>] [--surface <s>]
#   manual-test-review-dispatch.sh --help
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — completed (verdict recorded, OR story did not opt in = no-op, OR the
#       surface was SKIPPED/PENDING which are PASSED-equivalent)
#   1 — usage error
#   3 — manual-test verdict was FAILED (the per-story review should surface
#       this; whether it BLOCKS is owned by the existing advisory/gating
#       consumer in transition-story-status.sh + review_gate.manual_test_mode)
