# e28-s199-ci-finalize-gate.bats — regression coverage for E28-S199
# (Fix CI finalize-gate conditionality — skip ci_setup_exists on runs that
# did not produce output).
#
# The current behavior (pre-S199) of gaia-ci-setup/finalize.sh and
# gaia-ci-edit/finalize.sh unconditionally calls validate-gate.sh
# ci_setup_exists. On a fresh fixture the check fails and finalize
# exits 1, which masks real errors and blocks clean-fixture runs.
#
# Post-S199 behavior:
#   - gaia-ci-setup/finalize.sh  — the ci_setup_exists post-check is removed
#     outright (the skill is the producer; the gate is tautological). The
#     finalize script now exits 0 on fresh-fixture.
#   - gaia-ci-edit/finalize.sh    — keeps the ci_setup_exists gate as a
#     regression guard but gates it on a "had prior setup" marker file
#     written by gaia-ci-edit/setup.sh. Fresh-fixture → no marker → gate
#     skipped → exit 0. Prior-setup-existed → marker present → gate runs
#     and fails non-zero if the edit erased the file.
#
# Refs: E28-S199 story, E28-S197 triage findings (F3 / ContractBug).
