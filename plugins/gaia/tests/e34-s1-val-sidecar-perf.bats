# TC-VSP-7 — 100 consecutive invocations with distinct payloads.
# NFR-VSP-1: median sidecar-write latency <= 75ms on developer / CI hardware.
# Additional guard: no single invocation exceeds 1s.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stabilization strategy (E34-S3 / TD-66) — widen threshold with margin
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The original threshold (50ms) was authored without empirical measurement of
# the per-invocation floor. Profiling on three platforms (developer macOS,
# Linux GitHub Actions runners, Linux self-hosted runners) showed steady-state
# medians clustered around 50-55ms because val-sidecar-write.sh is fork/exec'd
# 100 times — the dominant per-call cost is process startup, not the write
# itself. Result: the test reported median ~51ms vs the 50ms threshold and
# was flaky on staging HEAD without any product-side change.
#
# Three stabilization options were considered (per E34-S3):
#   (a) Widen the threshold (with margin justification)
#   (b) Switch from median to p95
#   (c) Stabilize the harness (extra warm-ups, best-of-N batches)
#
# Option (c) was tried first (5 warm-up calls + best-of-3 batches) but the
# floor was confirmed genuinely above 50ms on developer hardware — harness
# stabilization moved the median by <0.5ms, not the ~2-5ms needed to clear
# the threshold. Option (b) would change what NFR-VSP-1 measures.
#
# We chose option (a). Threshold widened to 75ms — 50% margin above the
# observed floor (~50ms). The 75ms threshold is comfortably below any
# user-perceptible blocking I/O (the NFR's actual intent is "no command is
# blocked on slow sidecar I/O", which 75ms still satisfies). PRD NFR-VSP-1
# and architecture references updated in the same change to keep traceability
# (NFR-VSP-1 -> TC-VSP-7) consistent.
#
# Harness improvements from option (c) are kept because they reduce variance
# (5 warm-ups instead of 1; best-of-3 batches), tightening the test's signal
# even with the wider threshold.
