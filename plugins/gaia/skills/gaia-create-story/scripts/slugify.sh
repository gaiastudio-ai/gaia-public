# slugify.sh — gaia-create-story Step 4 deterministic slug generator (E63-S1 / Work Item 6.3)
#
# Purpose:
#   Convert a story title into a byte-deterministic filename slug. This script
#   is the dependency root for the E63 script tier — generate-frontmatter.sh
#   (E63-S3), validate-canonical-filename.sh (E63-S4), and scaffold-story.sh
#   (E63-S9) all consume the contract produced here.
#
# Algorithm (in order):
#   1. Read input from --title <string> or stdin (first one wins).
#   2. Lowercase the result (LC_ALL=C makes this a byte-level A-Z -> a-z).
#   3. Replace any non-alphanumeric byte with a single `-`. Under LC_ALL=C
#      the `[:alnum:]` class is the ASCII alnum set, so every non-ASCII byte
#      (e.g. the two-byte UTF-8 sequence for `é`, 0xC3 0xA9) is non-alnum
#      and is converted to `-`. THIS IS THE DELIBERATE DETERMINISM POLICY —
#      non-ASCII bytes become hyphens; they are NOT transliterated. A multi-
#      byte character therefore yields multiple consecutive hyphens which
#      step 4 collapses. If the team later prefers transliteration via
#      `iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII//TRANSLIT`, document the deviation in this
#      header and update E63-S4 fixtures in lockstep.
#   4. Collapse runs of `-` to a single `-`.
#   5. Trim a leading or trailing `-`.
#
# Empty-input contract:
#   Both an empty title and an all-non-alphanumeric title yield empty stdout
#   with exit code 0. Callers that need a non-empty slug must validate
#   upstream — this script does not police caller intent.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — success (including empty output)
#   non-zero — bash error only (e.g. unexpected flag)
#
# Locale invariance:
#   `LC_ALL=C` is set so character-class semantics in `tr` are byte-based and
#   identical across macOS, Linux, and CI runners.

# Canonical Usage block (E63-S12). Emitted to stdout for --help / -h so the
# block can be piped to `grep`, `less`, etc. without merging stderr. Sibling
# scripts (next-story-id.sh, generate-frontmatter.sh) emit Usage to stderr;
# slugify.sh deliberately uses stdout because (a) Test Scenario #1 specifies
# stdout containment and (b) the script's primary stdout payload (the slug)
# is never produced when --help is the dispatch, so there is no stream
# collision. The e2e AC2 defect-surface check uses `2>&1 | grep -i usage`
# and accepts either stream.

Usage: slugify.sh --title <s>
       slugify.sh --help | -h

Convert a story title into a byte-deterministic filename slug. The slug is
lowercased, non-alphanumeric bytes are replaced with `-`, runs of `-` are
collapsed, and a leading or trailing `-` is trimmed. Non-ASCII bytes are
dropped (deterministic policy — they are NOT transliterated).

Options:
  --title <s>    Title to slugify. If omitted, the first line of stdin is
                 used instead.
  --help, -h     Print this help block to stdout and exit 0.

Exit codes:
  0    success (including empty output for empty/all-non-alphanumeric input)
  2    usage error (unknown flag, --title without a value)
