# resolve-review-report-path.sh — single-source resolver for review-report write paths.
#
# The gaia-run-all-reviews canonical table is the source of the BASENAME for each
# review type (type-first: code-review-{key}.md, qa-tests-{key}.md, etc.).
# This helper resolves the DIRECTORY the report should be written to, so all six
# review skills + review-summary-gen.sh agree without re-implementing path logic:
#
#   - NEW canonical home (per-story layout): the per-story `reviews/` subdir
#     `${IMPL}/epic-{slug}/{key}-{slug}/reviews/<basename>` when the story lives
#     in the new per-story layout (resolved via resolve-story-file.sh: a
#     story.md whose parent dir carries the key). The reviews/ dir is created.
#   - Legacy fallback: the flat `${IMPL}/<basename>` (read-compat during the
#     migration window; also the target when the story is still flat/legacy-nested).
#
# Resolution is deterministic and side-effect-light: it only `mkdir -p`s the
# per-story reviews/ dir on the NEW-layout path (so the caller can write there).
#
# Usage:
#   resolve-review-report-path.sh --key <story_key> --type <review-type>
#   resolve-review-report-path.sh --help
#
# <review-type> is the type-first basename stem, e.g.:
#   code-review | qa-tests | security-review | test-automate-review |
#   test-review | performance-review
# The basename written is "<review-type>-<key>.md".
#
# Stdout: the absolute-or-relative report path to write.
# Exit codes: 0 ok; 1 usage/arg error.

resolve-review-report-path.sh — resolve a review report's write path

Usage: resolve-review-report-path.sh --key <story_key> --type <review-type>

Prints the per-story reviews/ path when the story is in the new layout, else
the flat implementation-artifacts/ path. Creates the per-story reviews/ dir on
the new-layout path. <review-type> is the type-first stem, e.g. code-review;
the basename is "<type>-<key>.md".
