## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-security-review/scripts/setup.sh

## Mission

**Deterministic tools provide evidence. The LLM provides judgment. The LLM consumes deterministic output; it does not override it.**

This is the unifying principle of every GAIA review skill (FR-DEJ-1, ADR-075). For `gaia-security-review` it means: deterministic tools (Semgrep ruleset, secret scanner, dependency CVE audit) run first and emit a structured `analysis-results.json` artifact. The LLM then performs an OWASP-aligned semantic review **on top of** that artifact — it cannot disregard a high-confidence Semgrep `p/security-audit` failure or a gitleaks hit on a production path, and it cannot relabel a tool failure as APPROVE. The verdict is computed by `verdict-resolver.sh` from the deterministic checks plus the LLM findings; the LLM never computes the verdict in natural language.

This skill pattern-matches against `gaia-code-review` (E65-S2) as the canonical reference. Per-skill specialization here = (a) the security toolkit (Semgrep + secret scan + dep audit) and (b) the OWASP-aligned severity rubric examples. Structural plumbing — fork dispatch, cache key, parent-mediated write — is identical to E65-S2.

**Fork context semantics (ADR-041, ADR-045, NFR-DEJ-4):** This skill runs under `context: fork` with read-only tools (`Read Grep Glob Bash`). It CANNOT modify files — the tool allowlist enforces no-write isolation. Persistence of the rendered review report is parent-mediated (Option A per ADR-075): the fork returns the rendered report payload to the parent context, and the parent writes the file. `Write` and `Edit` are NEVER added to the fork allowlist.

## Critical Rules

- A story key argument MUST be provided. If missing, fail fast with "usage: /gaia-security-review [story-key]".
- The story file MUST exist at `docs/implementation-artifacts/{story_key}-*.md`. Use the canonical glob to resolve regardless of title slug. If zero matches, fail with "story file not found for key {story_key}".
- The story MUST be in `review` status. If not, fail with "story must be in review status before security review".
- This skill is READ-ONLY in the fork. Do NOT attempt to call Write or Edit — the allowlist enforces this. Persistence is routed through the parent context.
- The verdict is `verdict-resolver.sh`'s output (APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | BLOCKED). The LLM MUST NOT compute or override it.
- Mapping to Review Gate canonical vocabulary (inline, no separate script): APPROVE → PASSED; REQUEST_CHANGES → FAILED; BLOCKED → FAILED.
- Determinism settings: `temperature: 0`, `model: claude-opus-4-7` (per ADR-074), `prompt_hash` recorded in the report header. Re-running with identical `analysis-results.json` MUST yield findings that match by category and severity (NFR-DEJ-2); textual variation is allowed.
- Sprint-status.yaml is NEVER written by this skill (Sprint-Status Write Safety rule).

## Determinism Settings

```
temperature: 0
model: claude-opus-4-7        # per ADR-074, frontmatter-pinned at fork dispatch
prompt_hash: sha256:<hex>     # recorded in report header at Phase 6
```

`prompt_hash` is the sha256 of (system prompt || `analysis-results.json` content). Two runs against unchanged inputs MUST produce findings that match by `{category, severity}` (NFR-DEJ-2). Textual message variation is allowed; category+severity divergence is an escalation signal — investigate model pin, temperature, or prompt-hash mismatch.

## Stack Toolkit Table

The toolkit invoked by Phase 3A is selected by the canonical stack name emitted by `load-stack-persona.sh`. Stack-key vocabulary is canonical across this skill and the script — they MUST match (EC-8). The Semgrep ruleset and secret scanner are stack-agnostic; only the dep-audit binary varies per stack:

| Stack key (canonical) | Semgrep ruleset                                          | Secret scanner | Dep-audit binary                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ts-dev`              | `p/security-audit` + `p/secrets` (+ `.semgrep/` if present) | `gitleaks`     | `npm audit`                                  |
| `java-dev`            | `p/security-audit` + `p/secrets` (+ `.semgrep/` if present) | `gitleaks`     | `mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check` |
| `python-dev`          | `p/security-audit` + `p/secrets` (+ `.semgrep/` if present) | `gitleaks`     | `pip-audit`                                  |
| `go-dev`              | `p/security-audit` + `p/secrets` (+ `.semgrep/` if present) | `gitleaks`     | `govulncheck ./...`                          |
| `flutter-dev`         | `p/security-audit` + `p/secrets` (+ `.semgrep/` if present) | `gitleaks`     | `dart pub audit` (or `pub-audit`)            |
| `mobile-dev`          | `p/security-audit` + `p/secrets` (+ `.semgrep/` if present) | `gitleaks`     | `swift package audit` / `gradle dependencyCheckAnalyze` |
| `angular-dev`         | `p/security-audit` + `p/secrets` (+ `.semgrep/` if present) | `gitleaks`     | `npm audit`                                  |

Phase 3A scope per FR-DEJ-3 is **strict**: Semgrep static analysis + secret scan + dep CVE audit. Phase 3A does NOT invoke linters, formatters, type checkers, or build verification — those belong to `gaia-code-review`. Phase 3A does NOT invoke test runners — those belong to `gaia-qa-tests` / `gaia-test-automate`.

Mismatched stack name (vocabulary drift between `load-stack-persona.sh` output and the table key) → silent skip on dep audit per FR-DEJ-4 case 3 with `skip_reason` populated.

## Severity Rubric

The LLM Phase 3B review applies the rubric below. Findings are organized by OWASP Top 10 category. Coverage targets the five categories most likely to surface in pre-merge review: **A01 Broken Access Control**, **A02 Cryptographic Failures**, **A03 Injection**, **A05 Security Misconfiguration**, **A07 Identification & Authentication Failures**. Other OWASP categories (A04, A06, A08, A09, A10) are still in scope; the rubric below seeds disambiguation for the high-frequency tiers.

The category+severity sets MUST match across two runs of identical inputs (NFR-DEJ-2 determinism contract); textual message variation is allowed. Category+severity divergence escalates as a model-pin or temperature regression.

### Critical

> Blocking. Produces `REQUEST_CHANGES` if the deterministic resolver did not already block. Critical-promotion threshold for Semgrep: `(rule_confidence: high) AND (rule_severity: high/error)` — prevents stock `p/security-audit` noise from forcing REQUEST_CHANGES on every diff (EC-1).

Examples (per OWASP category):

- **A01 Broken Access Control** — Admin route `/api/admin/users` reachable without authn middleware on the production-bound handler.
- **A01 Broken Access Control** — Object-level authz bypass: handler trusts a client-supplied `userId` parameter when the authenticated session already pins a different identity.
- **A02 Cryptographic Failures** — Hardcoded production API key checked into `src/config.ts:12` (gitleaks rule_confidence=high).
- **A02 Cryptographic Failures** — Symmetric encryption key derived from a constant string and used for at-rest PII encryption.
- **A03 Injection** — SQL injection in user-input path: handler concatenates `req.body.name` into a SQL string with no parameterization, Semgrep rule_confidence=high.
- **A03 Injection** — OS command injection: shell call with unescaped user input `exec("convert " + req.query.file)`.
- **A05 Security Misconfiguration** — Production CORS allows `*` on a credentialed endpoint.
- **A05 Security Misconfiguration** — Debug endpoint `/__debug__/dump` mounted on the production router with no flag gate.
- **A07 Identification & Authentication Failures** — Session cookie set without `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` on a production auth flow.
- **A07 Identification & Authentication Failures** — Password reset link uses a sequential-integer token with no expiry.

### Warning

> Non-blocking but worth surfacing. Persisted to the report.

Examples (per OWASP category):

- **A01 Broken Access Control** — Authz check present at the route layer but missing on a sibling handler that exposes the same resource — defense-in-depth gap.
- **A01 Broken Access Control** — Rate-limit middleware applied per-route but not per-user — abuse vector for an authenticated bulk endpoint.
- **A02 Cryptographic Failures** — Weak crypto used for a non-security hash (e.g., MD5 for cache-key fingerprint) — not directly exploitable but flagged for cleanup.
- **A02 Cryptographic Failures** — TLS 1.0/1.1 still listed in the cipher allowlist for a non-public endpoint; modern config recommended.
- **A03 Injection** — Unsafe regex on bounded input (ReDoS-medium): user input length-capped at 64 chars but the regex still has catastrophic backtracking on a ≤64-char attacker string.
- **A03 Injection** — Missing CSRF token on an idempotent `GET` route that nevertheless writes audit-log entries.
- **A05 Security Misconfiguration** — Verbose error response leaks internal class names (e.g., `NullPointerException at com.app.service.UserService.lookup`).
- **A05 Security Misconfiguration** — Default Express security headers (`x-powered-by: Express`) not stripped.
- **A07 Identification & Authentication Failures** — Password complexity policy enforced client-side only; server accepts any non-empty string.
- **A07 Identification & Authentication Failures** — Session timeout not documented anywhere; default framework behavior likely acceptable but unverified.

### Suggestion

> Non-blocking. Style/comment polish; no behavior implications. Includes context-aware downgrades.

Examples (per OWASP category):

- **A01 Broken Access Control** — Comment-only TODO referencing a future RBAC migration; no current finding, just a tracked intent.
- **A02 Cryptographic Failures** — Synthetic test secret with the `sk-test-` prefix in `tests/fixtures/auth.test.ts` — context-aware downgrade per EC-4 (test-fixture path rule).
- **A02 Cryptographic Failures** — High-entropy literal flagged by gitleaks but matches the hex-hash pattern (64 hex chars) in a constants file — entropy false-positive per EC-12.
- **A03 Injection** — Variable named `query` in a context that does NOT reach a SQL builder; misleading name worth a rename comment.
- **A05 Security Misconfiguration** — Deprecated TLS cipher in dev-only configuration (not production-reachable) — note for cleanup.
- **A05 Security Misconfiguration** — Verbose log message in a debug-only path; not user-facing.
- **A07 Identification & Authentication Failures** — Comment in auth flow could be tightened to clarify which token type is expected.
- **A06 Vulnerable Components** — Transitive CVE in dev-only dependency path (e.g., webpack plugin not in production bundle); evidence-gated downgrade Critical→Warning→Suggestion per EC-7.

**Context-aware downgrade rules (documented in rubric):**
- Test-fixture path (e.g., `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `*.test.*`) → secret findings downgrade to Suggestion (EC-4).
- High-entropy literal matching a known non-secret pattern (hex hash, base64-encoded UUID, fixed test-data fingerprint) → Suggestion (EC-12). LLM-cannot-override still applies if the deterministic tool's `rule_confidence` is high.
- Transitive CVE in a dev-only dependency path or unreachable code path → Warning (EC-7); LLM-cannot-override still applies for production-reachable CVEs.

## Phases

The skill is organized into seven canonical phases in this order: Setup → Story Gate → Phase 3A Deterministic Analysis → Phase 3B LLM Semantic Review → Architecture Conformance + Design Fidelity → Verdict → Output + Gate Update → Finalize. Each phase has explicit responsibilities; phase boundaries are non-negotiable.

### Phase 1 — Setup

- If no story key was provided as an argument, fail with: "usage: /gaia-security-review [story-key]"
- Resolve the story file path using the canonical glob: `docs/implementation-artifacts/{story_key}-*.md`. If zero matches: fail. If multiple matches: fail with "multiple story files matched key {story_key}".
- Read the resolved story file; parse YAML frontmatter to extract `status` and `figma:` block (if any).
- Invoke `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/load-stack-persona.sh --story-file <path>` in the parent context. The script emits the canonical stack name (`ts-dev`, `java-dev`, `python-dev`, `go-dev`, `flutter-dev`, `mobile-dev`, `angular-dev`) and lazy-loads the matching reviewer persona + memory sidecar BEFORE fork dispatch (NFR-DEJ-4 preserved). Forward the persona payload + canonical stack name into the fork.
- **Threat-model context (ADR-064).** When `docs/planning-artifacts/threat-model.md` exists, the skill loads it and injects it into the Phase 3B fork context under a "Threat Model Context" section. When the file is absent, proceed silently — preserves exact pre-E48-S2 behavior.
- **Tool prereq probe.** For each tool (Semgrep, gitleaks/trufflehog, the dep-audit binary listed in the toolkit row): probe via `command -v <tool>` first; fall back to local binaries. NEVER use `npx <tool> --version` — registry fetch breaks the NFR-DEJ-1 60s P95 budget. Cap each probe at 5s wall-clock; on timeout, log a Warning and continue (assume tool present). Capture each tool's reported version into `tool_versions` for the cache key.
- **Per-tool wall-clock caps (EC-10):** Semgrep ≤30s, secret scanner ≤15s, dep audit ≤15s. Cumulative Phase 3A budget ≤60s P95 cold (NFR-DEJ-1). On individual tool timeout, that tool's `status: errored` (NOT `failed` — timeout is not a finding); resolver maps to BLOCKED for the run.
- **Expected-missing-tool (FR-DEJ-4 case 1).** If a required toolkit binary is absent and not optional for the stack: emit Phase 1 BLOCKED with an actionable error message naming the missing tool and the install hint. Do NOT dispatch the fork.

### Phase 2 — Story Gate

- Status check: if `status` is not `review`, fail with "story {story_key} is in '{status}' status — must be in 'review' status for security review".
- Extract the File List section under "Dev Agent Record".
- Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/file-list-diff-check.sh --story-file <path> --base <branch> --repo <repo>`. The script returns a JSON-shaped report; surface divergence as a Warning to the user. **Story Gate semantics are advisory per FR-DEJ-2 — divergence does NOT halt the review.** Honor `no-file-list`, `empty-file-list`, and `divergence` reasons.
- Record divergence findings in `gate_warnings[]` of the eventual `analysis-results.json`.
- Missing-file handling: if a File List entry is absent from disk (renamed/deleted post-File-List-write), record it as a Warning finding under `category: integrity, severity: warning` in `analysis-results.json`. Do NOT crash; Phase 3A handles it gracefully.

### Phase 3A — Deterministic Analysis

Phase 3A is the **evidence layer**. Output: `analysis-results.json` written to `.review/gaia-security-review/{story_key}/analysis-results.json` validating against `plugins/gaia/schemas/analysis-results.schema.json` (`schema_version: "1.0"`).

**Toolkit invocation.** Look up the toolkit row in the Stack Toolkit Table above using the canonical stack name from Phase 1. Run Semgrep + secret scanner + dep-audit per row.

1. **Semgrep** — invoke with the registry packs `p/security-audit` + `p/secrets`. If `.semgrep/` exists in the repo root, also invoke the custom rules; if `.semgrep/` is missing or empty, silently skip the custom-rules step with `skip_reason: "no Semgrep custom rules at .semgrep/"` (EC-9). Semgrep wall-clock cap: 30s.
2. **Secret scanner** (gitleaks default; trufflehog acceptable per project policy) — invoke with explicit File List + working-tree scope. CLI flags MUST exclude `--history` mode (EC-2). For gitleaks: `--no-git` is REQUIRED to scope to the working tree only. Historical secrets are an out-of-scope concern for `/gaia-security-review` and belong to a separate periodic full-history scan. Secret scanner wall-clock cap: 15s.
3. **Dep CVE audit** — invoke the binary listed in the toolkit table for the resolved stack. Capture full advisory output. Dep audit wall-clock cap: 15s.

**Status taxonomy (FR-DEJ-4).** Each tool invocation produces exactly one of:
- `status: passed` — tool ran to completion, no findings, exit code zero.
- `status: failed` — tool ran to completion AND emitted findings (e.g., Semgrep exit 1 with security findings; gitleaks exit 1 on secret detection; npm-audit exit 1 with CVE findings). Maps to REQUEST_CHANGES via verdict-resolver precedence rule 2 (LLM-cannot-override).
- `status: errored` — tool crashed mid-run, returned an unclassified non-zero exit code, OR exceeded its wall-clock cap. Maps to BLOCKED via precedence rule 1. Examples: Semgrep parse error on malformed source (EC-5); npm-audit network failure; tool wall-clock timeout (EC-10). Even when partial findings were emitted before the crash, `errored` wins over partial findings.
- `status: skipped` — tool not applicable; `skip_reason` populated verbatim. Examples: `skip_reason: "no Semgrep custom rules at .semgrep/"` (EC-9); dep-audit binary absent for an exotic stack (FR-DEJ-4 case 3).

**Distinguish `failed` vs `errored` by exit-code semantics, not by exit code alone** (consistent with E65-S2 EC-6). Semgrep exits 1 on findings (failed) and 2 on parse error/crash (errored). gitleaks exits 1 on secret detection (failed) and 2 on config/io error (errored).

**Path normalization (EC-13).** Tool outputs vary in path convention:
- Semgrep emits absolute paths.
- gitleaks emits paths relative to repo root.
- npm audit emits package names with no file path.

Phase 3A normalizes all `findings[].file` to repo-relative before writing `analysis-results.json`. Package-only findings (npm audit / pip-audit / govulncheck) use a synthetic location field formatted as `package.json:dependencies.<pkg>` (or per-stack equivalent: `pyproject.toml:dependencies.<pkg>`, `go.mod:require <pkg>`).

**Finding deduplication (EC-11).** Phase 3A deduplicates findings across tools by the tuple `(file, line, finding_type)` before passing to Phase 3B. Example: an API key on `src/config.ts:12` flagged by both gitleaks and Semgrep `p/secrets` is deduplicated to a single finding. The dedup key is documented here so resolver counts unique findings only.

**Cache plumbing (FR-DEJ-11).** Cache lives at `.review/gaia-security-review/{story_key}/.cache/`. Cache directory created via `mkdir -p` (idempotent and concurrency-safe).

Cache key:
```
sha256(
  File List contents
  || file_hashes (sha256 per File List entry, sorted)
  || tool_config blob
  || tool_versions (sorted "tool:version" lines)
  || resolved_config_hash
  || advisory_db_fingerprint
)
```

`advisory_db_fingerprint` is the sha256 of `npm audit --json | jq .metadata.advisories` for npm, or the per-stack equivalent (e.g., `pip-audit --vulnerability-service osv` digest, or a daily date-stamp proxy). This is the EC-3 mitigation: the dep-audit advisory database refreshes daily without changing the binary version. Without this fingerprint, a story marked safe yesterday can have new CVEs today and the cache would return a stale safe verdict.

`resolved_config_hash` is the sha256 of the rendered Semgrep configuration (registry packs + custom rules content) — NOT the raw `.semgrep/` directory listing.

Cache lookup:
1. Compute the candidate cache key from current File List + tool versions + resolved configs + advisory_db_fingerprint.
2. Look up `.review/gaia-security-review/{story_key}/.cache/{cache_key}.json`. On miss: run tools.
3. On candidate hit, **revalidate file_hashes** against current on-disk file hashes. A file in the File List can be edited externally without changing any cache-key input — if any cached `file_hashes` entry diverges from the current on-disk hash, treat as miss.

Cache write (same-story parallel-invocation safety):
- Write `analysis-results.json` to a per-PID temp path: `.review/gaia-security-review/{story_key}/.cache/.tmp.<pid>.<timestamp>.json`.
- `mv` (atomic rename) to the final `.cache/{cache_key}.json` path. Atomic rename gives last-writer-wins without corruption.
- Cross-story parallel invocations are safe by per-story directory partitioning.
- Persist via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/checkpoint.sh write --workflow security-review --step 3 --file <results.json> --var cache_key=<hash>` so `checkpoint.sh validate --workflow security-review` can detect drift later.

Phase 3A also emits a rendered `.md` companion alongside `analysis-results.json` — a human-readable summary of per-tool status and findings count for log inspection.

### Phase 3B — LLM Semantic Review

Phase 3B is the **judgment layer**. The fork subagent reads `analysis-results.json` as evidence and applies the OWASP-aligned severity rubric to produce category-organized Critical / Warning / Suggestion findings.

**Fork dispatch contract.**
- `context: fork`
- `allowed-tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Bash]` (frontmatter-enforced; no Write/Edit ever)
- `model: claude-opus-4-7` (frontmatter-pinned per ADR-074)
- `temperature: 0`
- Inputs forwarded into the fork: persona payload (from Phase 1), `analysis-results.json` content, story file path, severity rubric (this section), and — when present — the threat-model context loaded in Phase 1.

**Output contract.** Fork returns a structured findings JSON with shape `{ "findings": [{"category", "severity", "file", "line", "message", "threat_ref?"}, ...] }`. The fork ALSO returns the rendered report payload as its conversational output — the parent will validate the structure in Phase 6 before persisting.

**OWASP categorization.** Each finding carries an `owasp_category` (e.g., `A01`, `A02`, `A03`, `A05`, `A07`). Findings outside the OWASP Top 10 are categorized as `category: integrity` for missing-file divergence or `category: fidelity` for design-token drift, consistent with the cross-skill convention.

**Determinism contract (NFR-DEJ-2).** Two runs against unchanged `analysis-results.json` MUST produce findings that match by `{category, severity}`. Textual message variation is allowed. Category+severity divergence is an escalation signal — investigate model pin, temperature, or prompt-hash mismatch. The bats determinism regression test compares ONLY `{category, severity}` sets across two runs.

**Prompt hash recording.** The fork records `prompt_hash` (sha256 of system prompt || `analysis-results.json` content) in the report header. This is the audit trail for determinism debugging.

**Context-aware classification (rubric-driven).** Per the Severity Rubric above:
- Test-fixture path → secret findings downgrade to Suggestion (EC-4).
- High-entropy literal matching hex-hash / base64-UUID pattern → Suggestion (EC-12).
- Transitive CVE in dev-only dependency path or unreachable code path → Warning (EC-7).
- Semgrep finding promotes to Critical only when `(rule_confidence: high) AND (rule_severity: high/error)` (EC-1).

LLM-cannot-override invariant: a high-confidence deterministic finding cannot be downgraded by the LLM into APPROVE territory. The rubric downgrades above apply to LLM tier classification (Suggestion vs Warning vs Critical) — NOT to the verdict-resolver.sh blocking decision when the deterministic tool emits `status: failed` with a blocking finding.

### Phase 4 — Architecture Conformance + Design Fidelity

The fork extends Phase 3B's findings with architecture and design checks; findings flow into the Phase 3B category buckets.

- **Security-architecture conformance.** Fork reads `docs/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` and (when present) `docs/planning-artifacts/threat-model.md`. For each File List entry, verify authn/authz boundaries align with the documented gateway/middleware pattern, secret-storage references match the documented vault path, and any ADRs referenced by the story exist with status Accepted. Findings under `category: architecture`.
- **Threat-model cross-reference.** When threat-model context was provided, findings that match a modeled threat carry an optional `threat_ref` field (e.g., `threat_ref: "T3"`). Format the cross-reference inline as `(see T3 in threat model)`.
- **Design fidelity.** If the story frontmatter has a `figma:` block, fork compares design-token references in the changed code against `docs/planning-artifacts/design-system/design-tokens.json`. Findings under `category: fidelity`. If no `figma:` block: skip silently (no Warning, no finding).

### Phase 5 — Verdict

The verdict is computed by `verdict-resolver.sh`. The LLM never computes or overrides it.

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/verdict-resolver.sh \
  --analysis-results .review/gaia-security-review/{story_key}/analysis-results.json \
  --llm-findings .review/gaia-security-review/{story_key}/llm-findings.json
```

The resolver applies strict first-match-wins precedence (FR-DEJ-6):
1. Any check `status: errored` → **BLOCKED**.
2. Any check `status: failed` with blocking finding → **REQUEST_CHANGES**. *The LLM cannot override this — rule 2 wins over rule 4 (LLM APPROVE) every time.*
3. Any LLM finding `severity: Critical` → **REQUEST_CHANGES**.
4. Otherwise → **APPROVE**.

Stdout is exactly one of `APPROVE | REQUEST_CHANGES | BLOCKED`. **Mapping to Review Gate canonical vocabulary is inline (no separate `verdict-normalizer.sh`):**

| Resolver output  | Review Gate verdict |
|------------------|---------------------|
| APPROVE          | PASSED              |
| REQUEST_CHANGES  | FAILED              |
| BLOCKED          | FAILED              |

This three-line mapping is local to this section per PRD §4.37. If a future review skill diverges, extract to a shared script then (YAGNI).

### Phase 6 — Output + Gate Update

Phase 6 is the **persistence layer**. The fork CANNOT write — persistence is parent-mediated (Option A per ADR-075).

**Fork output.** The fork returns a rendered report payload as its conversational output. The report MUST contain:

- Header: story key, title, prompt_hash, model, temperature.
- `## Deterministic Analysis` — per-tool status table + per-tool findings list (from `analysis-results.json`).
- `## LLM Semantic Review` — Critical / Warning / Suggestion organized by OWASP category (A01..A10) plus `architecture`, `fidelity`, and `integrity` non-OWASP buckets.
- Final line, exactly: `**Verdict: APPROVE**` or `**Verdict: REQUEST_CHANGES**` or `**Verdict: BLOCKED**`.

**Parent payload validation.** Before persisting, the parent context validates the fork output structure:
- `## Deterministic Analysis` section present.
- `## LLM Semantic Review` section present.
- Final line matches regex `^\*\*Verdict: (APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES|BLOCKED)\*\*$`.

**Malformed-payload handling.** On any of the above checks failing, the parent persists what it received with an explicit `[INCOMPLETE]` marker prepended to the report, and emits `verdict=BLOCKED` to `review-gate.sh`. Fork output untrustworthy → BLOCKED. The bats fixture covers this case explicitly (mirrors E65-S2 EC-9).

**Parent write to FR-402 locked path.** The parent context writes the rendered report to `docs/implementation-artifacts/security-review-E<NN>-S<NNN>.md` per FR-402 naming convention. The path is **locked**: `security-review-{story_key}.md` — no slug, no date suffix.

**Re-run handling.** Parent **overwrites** the existing review file on re-run (latest verdict wins). No append, no version-suffix. The `review-gate.sh` row update is the source of truth for verdict history if needed.

**Gate row update.** Parent invokes the individual gate update (single-line form): `review-gate.sh update --story "{story_key}" --gate "Security Review" --verdict "{PASSED|FAILED}"`. Equivalent multi-line form for readability:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/review-gate.sh update \
  --story "{story_key}" \
  --gate "Security Review" \
  --verdict "{PASSED|FAILED}"
```

Mapping per Phase 5 table. Confirm exit code 0.

**Composite review gate check.** After the row update, parent invokes the composite check informationally:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/review-gate.sh review-gate-check --story "{story_key}"
```

Capture stdout for the `Review Gate: COMPLETE|PENDING|BLOCKED` summary (per ADR-054). Do NOT halt on non-zero exit. Sprint-status.yaml may be out of sync — surface a hint to run `/gaia-sprint-status`.

**Fork allowlist sanity.** The frontmatter `allowed-tools` MUST remain exactly `[Read, Grep, Glob, Bash]`. The `evidence-judgment-parity.bats` AC1 assertion catches any post-merge regression that adds Write or Edit.

### Phase 7 — Finalize

- Surface the verdict to the orchestrator per ADR-063 (mandatory verdict surfacing).
- Persist findings to the per-skill checkpoint via `checkpoint.sh write` (already invoked in Phase 3A for the cache; final state recorded via the standard `finalize.sh` hook).
- The Phase 3A artifact is cached for the next run by the `.cache/{cache_key}.json` write performed in Phase 3A.
