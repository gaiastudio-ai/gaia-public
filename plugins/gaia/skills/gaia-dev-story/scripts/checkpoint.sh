# checkpoint.sh — gaia-dev-story PostToolUse hook target (E28-S53)
#
# This is the skill-local checkpoint wrapper invoked by the PostToolUse hook.
# It translates the simple `checkpoint.sh write gaia-dev-story` invocation
# into the shared foundation checkpoint.sh's --workflow/--step contract.
#
# PostToolUse hooks fire after every Edit/Write tool invocation. This script
# uses --step 0 as a sentinel value to distinguish hook-triggered checkpoints
# from explicit workflow-step checkpoints.
#
# The write is atomic: the shared checkpoint.sh writes to a temp file and
# renames into place. This script is safe to call from rapid/parallel tool
# invocations.
#
# Usage (from PostToolUse hook):
#   checkpoint.sh write gaia-dev-story
#
# Environment:
#   CHECKPOINT_PATH — required. Set by setup.sh or resolve-config.sh.
#   CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR — optional. If unset, logs a warning but continues.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — checkpoint written (or skipped with warning)
#   1 — hard failure
