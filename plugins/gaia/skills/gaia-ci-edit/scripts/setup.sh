# setup.sh — Cluster 11 gaia-ci-edit skill setup (E28-S86)
#
# Mechanical extension of the Cluster 9 reference implementation authored
# under E28-S66 (gaia-code-review/scripts/setup.sh). Only WORKFLOW_NAME and
# SCRIPT_NAME differ — the body follows the shared pattern.
#
# Responsibilities (per brief Cluster 9):
#   1. Resolve config via the shared resolve-config.sh foundation script
#   2. Run validate-gate.sh prereq check (AC-EC3, AC-EC5)
#   3. Load the checkpoint state for this workflow
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — setup succeeded, skill body can run
#   1 — config resolution, gate validation, or checkpoint load failed
#
# POSIX discipline: bash with [[ ]] and indexed arrays only. LC_ALL=C for
# deterministic output. macOS /bin/bash 3.2 compatible.

# ---------- 2b. Record "had prior setup" marker (E28-S199) ----------
#
# E28-S199 introduces a conditional guard on the `ci_setup_exists` post-check
# in finalize.sh. The guard uses a runtime marker file:
#
#   ${PROJECT_ROOT:-$PWD}/.gaia/run-state/ci-edit-had-prior-setup
#
# setup.sh probes for docs/test-artifacts/ci-setup.md at invocation time.
# If it exists, a prior CI setup is in place and an edit is genuinely
# editing an existing file — in that case finalize.sh MUST still invoke
# ci_setup_exists as a regression guard (catches the "edit erased the
# file" bug class — AC6). If the setup file is absent at invocation time,
# no marker is written and finalize.sh skips the gate entirely (AC5:
# fresh-fixture runs exit 0 cleanly).
#
# The marker is plain-filesystem state, not config: it describes "what the
# edit observed at invocation" rather than "how the skill is configured."
# Cleanup is finalize.sh's responsibility — see that script for the
# companion logic. Error-path cleanup is bounded by the TEST_ARTIFACTS
# resolution below and the run-state directory being per-project, so a
# stale marker at worst causes the next edit run to treat an absent
# file as "had prior setup" — which is the SAFER failure mode (gate runs,
# catches the missing file, exits non-zero).
