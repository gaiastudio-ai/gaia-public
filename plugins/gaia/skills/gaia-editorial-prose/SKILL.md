## Mission

You are performing a **clinical copy-editing review** on the document the user supplies. You evaluate the target across seven prose dimensions — ambiguity, inconsistency, redundancy, jargon, passive voice, sentence complexity, and tone shifts — and produce a markdown findings report. Every finding names a specific line (or section) in the source, classifies severity (critical / major / minor / style), and offers a concrete fix the author can accept or reject.

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/core/tasks/editorial-review-prose.xml` task (42 lines). Per **ADR-041** (Native Execution Model) and **ADR-042** (Scripts-over-LLM for Deterministic Operations), the legacy task-runner engine is retired and this skill runs natively under the Claude Code primitives model (skills + subagents + plugins + hooks).

## Critical Rules

- **Review only — never rewrite the document.** The skill is strictly read-only on the target. Findings go in the report; the author decides which to apply.
- **Flag issues with specific line references and suggested fixes.** Every finding cites a line number (or section heading + offset) and includes a concrete fix suggestion — not vague "this could be clearer" observations.
- **Categorize every finding by severity:** `critical` (meaning-breaking), `major` (likely misread), `minor` (stylistic improvement), `style` (preference).
- **Prose-only scope.** Section reordering, TOC restructuring, hierarchy changes, and information-architecture issues are **out of scope** — route the author to `/gaia-editorial-structure`. If you notice structural issues during the prose pass, record them in a separate "Structural observations" note at the end of the report but do NOT expand them into findings.
- Do NOT modify the source document. The report artifact is the only output.

## Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS`: optional target document path. If omitted, ask the user inline: "Which document should I review for prose quality?"

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Load Document

- If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, use it as the target path. Otherwise ask the user inline for the document to review.
- Read the entire document with the Read tool.
- Note the document type (PRD, story, architecture, README, changelog, etc.) — type informs what reads as acceptable jargon vs. out-of-place jargon.

### Step 2 — Analyze Prose

Scan the document across these seven categories (the full set inherited from the legacy task):

- **Ambiguity** — vague terms, unclear referents ("this", "that", "it" with no antecedent), multiple interpretations of a single sentence.
- **Inconsistency** — the same term used with different meanings, or different terms used for the same concept, across the document.
- **Redundancy** — information repeated without new value, verbose phrases that can be shortened.
- **Jargon** — unexplained technical terms, acronyms introduced without definition, vocabulary that assumes domain knowledge the audience does not have.
- **Passive voice** — places where active voice would be clearer and attribute agency more cleanly.
- **Sentence complexity** — sentences over ~40 words, nested clauses three-deep or more, instructions buried inside compound-complex structures.
- **Tone shifts** — inconsistent voice or formality level (e.g., shifting between first-person and third-person, between casual and formal, between imperative and passive instruction).

### Step 3 — Generate Report

Produce a markdown findings report with this structure:

1. **Executive summary** — one paragraph naming the overall readability verdict and the top two or three thematic issues.
2. **Findings table** — columns: severity, location (line or section), issue, suggested fix. One row per finding.
3. **Overall readability score** — one of: `Clear` / `Mostly Clear` / `Needs Work` / `Major Issues`.

The report is the only output artifact. It is displayed to the user. If the user asks the skill to save the report to disk, write it with the Read tool's companion writer — but the default is display-only to mirror the legacy task's behavior.
