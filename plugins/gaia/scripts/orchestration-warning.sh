#!/usr/bin/env bash
# orchestration-warning.sh — orchestration mode lossiness warning.
#
# Emits a one-shot per-session warning when a heavy-procedural or
# conversational skill starts in Mode A (subagent dispatch). Mode A is
# lossy for those skill classes because each subagent dispatch creates
# a fresh forked context that cannot return rich state to the parent
# orchestrator — the orchestrator receives only structured returns
# (summary, findings, verdict), not the full reasoning trace.
#
# Mode B (Agent Teams persistent teammates) preserves in-conversation
# state across dispatches and is the recommended mode for these classes.
# The warning informs the user of the trade-off and how to enable Mode B.
#
# One-shot semantics:
#   A marker file at $CHECKPOINT_PATH/orchestration-warning-shown.{session_id}
#   suppresses repeat warnings within the same session. The marker is
#   keyed on session_id, so a new session re-emits the warning once.
#
#   CAVEAT: Without `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` exported, the marker
#   falls back to the PID of the orchestrator process. Each fresh shell PID
#   becomes a new "session" from the dedupe's point of view, so the warning
#   re-fires on every command invocation rather than once. Operators who
#   see repeat warnings should export `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` (any stable value
#   per real session) so the one-shot contract holds.
#
# Once-per-session is by design, not per-invocation:
#   The warning fires AT MOST once per session — not on every skill call. A
#   fresh session legitimately needs the Mode-A-lossiness notice because the
#   trade-off applies to that session's dispatches. Suppressing it further
#   (once-per-host / opt-in only) would hide a real fidelity trade-off from a
#   user who has not seen it this session. The session-keyed marker is the
#   intended noise floor; the GC below reaps stale per-session markers so they
#   do not accumulate.
#
# When NO warning is emitted (silent exit 0):
#   - skill class is `light-procedural` (cheap; no continuity benefit)
#   - skill class is `reviewer` (one-shot fork by design)
#   - active mode is `team` (Mode B; full fidelity; no trade-off)
#   - marker file for this session already exists (one-shot honored)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — script completed (warning emitted or suppressed)
#   2 — usage error
#
# POSIX discipline: bash 3.2 compatible (macOS default).

Usage:
  orchestration-warning.sh --skill-class <class> --mode <mode>
                           [--session-id <id>]
                           [--checkpoint-path <dir>]

Arguments:
  --skill-class:     one of {reviewer, light-procedural, heavy-procedural,
                     conversational}. Typically read from the calling skill's
                     SKILL.md orchestration_class frontmatter.
  --mode:            one of {subagent, team}. Typically the output of
                     detect-orchestration-mode.sh at skill startup.
  --session-id:      session identifier used to key the one-shot marker.
                     Defaults to ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-PID-of-orchestrator}.
  --checkpoint-path: directory for the marker file. Defaults to
                     ${CHECKPOINT_PATH:-./_memory/checkpoints}.

Emits the lossy-mode warning to stdout once per session when
skill-class ∈ {heavy-procedural, conversational} AND mode == subagent.

# Surface-above-fold contract.

# Claude Code's CLI auto-collapses Bash tool-call output beyond a few lines,
# so a multi-line warning emitted to stdout can be invisible to users who
# don't expand the tool call. To surface the warning above the collapse
# fold, this helper now:
#
#   1. Writes the full warning text to a sentinel file at
#      ${checkpoint_path}/orchestration-warning-pending.${session_id}.
#   2. Prints a single-line `SURFACE-WARNING: <sentinel-path>` banner as
#      the FIRST stdout line — short enough to stay above any auto-collapse
#      threshold, and a machine-recognizable marker the SKILL.md prelude
#      pattern can match.
#   3. Continues to print the full warning text to stdout for backward
#      compatibility with existing callers, fixtures, and bats tests that
#      grep for the warning body.
#
# Callers that want to surface the warning to the user (the GAIA SKILL.md
# prelude pattern does this) `cat` the sentinel file and emit its contents
# as user-visible conversation text. Callers that don't care continue to
# behave as before.

GAIA orchestration: running in subagent mode (Mode A)

The skill you're invoking belongs to a class (heavy-procedural or
conversational) whose output benefits from cross-step context. Mode A
dispatches each sub-agent in its own forked context, so context may
be lossy between steps — sub-agents return summaries, not full reasoning.

For the full-fidelity experience, enable Mode B (Agent Teams):
  1. Set CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 in your environment.
  2. Add orchestration.mode: team to .gaia/config/project-config.yaml.

Mode B uses persistent teammates that preserve in-conversation state
across dispatches.

This warning is shown once per session when a stable session id is available
(CLAUDE_SESSION_ID); if the host does not propagate one, dedupe falls back to
the orchestrator PID and the warning may re-fire across sub-process boundaries.
