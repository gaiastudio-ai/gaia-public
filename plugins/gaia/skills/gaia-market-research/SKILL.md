## Setup

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-market-research/scripts/setup.sh

## Mission

You are facilitating a market research session. Guide the user through scope definition, competitive analysis, customer research, and market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM), then emit a structured market research report at `docs/planning-artifacts/market-research.md` for downstream consumers (e.g., `/gaia-domain-research`, `/gaia-product-brief`).

This skill is the native Claude Code conversion of the legacy `_gaia/lifecycle/workflows/1-analysis/market-research` workflow (brief §Cluster 4, story P4-S3). The step ordering, prompts, and output location follow the legacy `instructions.xml` mechanically — do not restructure, re-prompt, or reorder sections.

## Critical Rules

- Check web access availability before proceeding with research.
- If no web access, proceed with user-provided data and general knowledge only.
- State all market sizing assumptions clearly.
- The output file path is `docs/planning-artifacts/market-research.md` — downstream consumers read this exact path, so do not relocate it.
- Mechanical port: the six legacy steps below must appear in this exact order.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Scope Definition

Ask the user, in order, and wait for a response on each:

- **"What market or industry do you want to research?"**
- **"Are there specific competitors you want analyzed?"**
- **"What geographic scope? (global, regional, local)"**

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-market-research 1 research_topic="$RESEARCH_TOPIC" competitor_set="$COMPETITOR_SET"`

### Step 2 — Web Access Check

- Check if MCP web tools are available for live research.
- If web access is available, proceed with live web research in subsequent steps.
- If no web access, notify the user: *"Web access unavailable. Proceeding with user-provided data and general knowledge. Results may be less comprehensive."*

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-market-research 2 research_topic="$RESEARCH_TOPIC" competitor_set="$COMPETITOR_SET"`

### Step 3 — Competitive Analysis

- Identify and analyze competitors (direct and indirect).
- For each competitor capture: strengths, weaknesses, market position, pricing model.
- Create a competitive positioning matrix.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-market-research 3 research_topic="$RESEARCH_TOPIC" competitor_set="$COMPETITOR_SET"`

### Step 4 — Customer Research

- Define target customer segments.
- Analyze user behavior patterns and needs.
- Identify underserved needs and market gaps.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-market-research 4 research_topic="$RESEARCH_TOPIC" competitor_set="$COMPETITOR_SET"`

### Step 5 — Market Sizing

- Estimate Total Addressable Market (TAM).
- Estimate Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM).
- Estimate Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM).
- State all assumptions clearly.

> `!scripts/write-checkpoint.sh gaia-market-research 5 research_topic="$RESEARCH_TOPIC" competitor_set="$COMPETITOR_SET"`

### Step 6 — Generate Output

Write a structured market research report to `docs/planning-artifacts/market-research.md` containing, in order:

- **Executive Summary**
- **Competitive Analysis** — direct and indirect competitors with strengths, weaknesses, market position, pricing model, and a competitive positioning matrix
- **Customer Segments** — target segments, behavior patterns, needs, and market gaps
- **Market Sizing** — TAM, SAM, SOM with all assumptions stated
- **Key Findings**
- **Strategic Recommendations**

> `!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/detect-open-questions.sh docs/planning-artifacts/market-research.md`

## Validation

<!--
  E42-S2 — V1→V2 28-item checklist port (FR-341, FR-359).
  Classification (28 items total):
    - Script-verifiable: 18 (SV-01..SV-18) — enforced by finalize.sh.
    - LLM-checkable:     10 (LLM-01..LLM-10) — evaluated by the host LLM
      against the market-research artifact below.
  Exit code 0 when all script-verifiable items PASS; non-zero otherwise.
  Dedup rule applied to V1 surface (2 rules + 15 checkboxes = 17 lines):
    - "At least 3 competitors analyzed" rule == Competition checkbox (1 item).
    - "TAM/SAM/SOM estimates provided with assumptions" rule collapses
      into the three Market Sizing dimension checkboxes (6 items after
      estimate+assumptions split).
  After dedup V1 yields 15 distinct items; expansion to 28 splits
  TAM/SAM/SOM into estimate+assumptions (+3 net), treats each of the 4
  required output sections as a separate item (+3 net vs. "all required
  sections present"), and adds an Executive Summary / Key Findings /
  Strategic Recommendations section check to mirror the V2 Step 6 output
  contract. See docs/implementation-artifacts/E42-S2-port-gaia-market-research-28-item-checklist-to-v2.md.

## Finalize

!${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/gaia-market-research/scripts/finalize.sh

## Next Steps

- **Primary:** `/gaia-product-brief` — consolidate market findings into a structured product brief.
- **Alternative:** `/gaia-domain-research` — when domain or industry depth is still needed.
- **Alternative:** `/gaia-tech-research` — when technology evaluation must run before the brief.
