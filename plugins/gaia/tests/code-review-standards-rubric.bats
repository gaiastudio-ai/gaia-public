# code-review-standards-rubric.bats — E65-S8 shared rubric format coverage.
#
# Asserts that gaia-code-review-standards/SKILL.md (the shared skill) carries
# the canonical severity rubric format with concrete examples per applicable
# tier per FR-DEJ-7, AND that all six review consumer SKILL.md files contain
# the canonical cross-link string above their per-skill examples.
#
# Test scenarios covered:
#   TC-DEJ-RUBRIC-01 — shared rubric format documented (5 tiers present).
#   TC-DEJ-RUBRIC-02 — Critical-readability tier verbatim "None — readability
#                      never blocks (max severity is Warning)".
#   EC-1 / EC-7      — canonical cross-link string present in 6 consumer files.
#   EC-3             — cross-link uses canonical skill name `gaia-code-review-
#                      standards`, not relative paths.
#   EC-5             — existing checklist + complexity thresholds + SOLID
#                      sections preserved verbatim in shared SKILL.md.
#   EC-8             — ≥2 examples per applicable tier in shared SKILL.md.
