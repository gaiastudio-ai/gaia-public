# helper itself logs warnings to stderr but never affects this script's
# exit code. SKILL_NAME is resolved from the parent directory name so
# the wire-in is identical across all 24 Phase 1-3 finalize.sh files.

# ---------- 5. Matrix-verdict gate ----------
# validate-gate.sh traceability_exists can return exit 0 against matrices
# that declared their OWN verdict as BLOCKED — the check is path-based,
# not semantic. Per the /gaia-readiness-check Critical Rules, if the
# matrix's gate verdict is BLOCKED, downstream must not declare
# traceability_complete: true. This block surfaces a WARNING when the
# generated matrix declares BLOCKED or FAIL so the caller has an explicit
# signal rather than burying it inside the artifact body.
#
# Idempotent: when no matrix is present (skill ran in --dry-run or the
# write was skipped), this block is a silent no-op.
# The traceability-matrix now lives under planning-artifacts/
# (docs-about-testing moved out of test-artifacts/). The
# planning-artifacts/ home is highest precedence; the legacy test-artifacts/
# (strategy/) paths remain for the migration read-compat window.
