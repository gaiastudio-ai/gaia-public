# run-red-phase.sh — /gaia-atdd Step 5b red-phase execution (E46-S3)
#
# Optional red-phase test runner invoked after Step 5 (Validation) when the
# user opts in at the "Run generated tests now to confirm red phase? [y/N]"
# prompt. Detects the configured runner via the Test Execution Bridge
# (ADR-026 / test-environment.yaml). When the bridge is disabled or the
# config is missing, the runner short-circuits with a warning — never fails
# the overall /gaia-atdd invocation (AC-EC4).
#
# Usage:
#   run-red-phase.sh --tests <path> [--timeout <seconds>]
#
# Options:
#   --tests <path>      Path to a generated atdd-{story_key}.md artifact (required)
#   --timeout <sec>     Per-test timeout in seconds (default: 30, AC-EC5)
#   --help, -h          Show this help and exit 0
#
# Behavior:
#   - Reads {GAIA_PROJECT_ROOT}/docs/test-artifacts/test-environment.yaml.
#   - If absent or bridge_enabled is false: log a "Test runner not configured —
#     skipping red-phase execution" warning and exit 0 (AC-EC4 non-blocking).
#   - Otherwise: invoke the configured runner against --tests, enforce the
#     per-test timeout, and print a single-line "pass/fail counts" summary.
#   - Tests are expected to FAIL (red phase). Unexpected passes are flagged
#     with a warning but do not change the exit status.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   Always for non-blocking branches (no runner, runner produced output)
#   1   Internal usage error (missing required arg)

The script invokes the configured Test Execution Bridge runner against the
provided artifact and reports a pass/fail count summary. When no runner is
configured, the script logs a warning and exits 0 (non-blocking, AC-EC4).
