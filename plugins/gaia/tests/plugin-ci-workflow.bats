# plugin-ci-workflow.bats — E28-S175 regression guard for the plugin-ci.yml
# workflow shape.
#
# The `bats-tests` job previously ran `sudo apt-get install -y jq kcov` on
# Ubuntu 24.04 (noble), which fails with "E: Unable to locate package kcov"
# because kcov is not in noble's default apt repositories. This test locks in
# the shape of the fix so that a future edit cannot silently reintroduce the
# apt install of kcov and break CI on every PR again.
#
# AC mapping:
#   AC1 — bats-tests job must run to completion on noble → asserted indirectly
#         by AC2 below (if kcov is not in the apt install line, the install
#         step no longer fails).
#   AC2 — kcov must not appear in the apt install command for bats-tests.
#   AC3 — bats suite must still be invoked (run-with-coverage.sh).
#   AC4 — if kcov is dropped, the workflow yaml must carry a comment
#         explaining the decision so future maintainers understand the gap.
