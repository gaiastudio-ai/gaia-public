# promotion-chain-guard.sh — gaia-dev-story Steps 13–16 promotion-chain gate (E57-S6, P0-3)
#
# Reads ci_cd.promotion_chain[0].branch from the resolved project config and
# emits a deterministic two-state verdict:
#
#   PRESENT path: stdout = "PRESENT:<branch>"; stderr empty; exit 0.
#                 The <branch> portion always matches ^[a-z0-9-]+$.
#   ABSENT  path: stdout empty; stderr = "ABSENT: ci_cd.promotion_chain not
#                 configured. Run /gaia-ci-edit to add a promotion chain.";
#                 exit 1.
#
# No positional args. Reads from $PROJECT_CONFIG (default:
# config/project-config.yaml relative to CWD).
#
# YAML parsing strategy (mirrors gaia-public/plugins/gaia/scripts/lib/
# dev-story-security-invariants.sh::assert_pr_target_from_chain): prefer
# `yq -r .ci_cd.promotion_chain[0].branch` when available; otherwise fall
# back to a small awk state machine that locates the first `branch:` line
# under the `promotion_chain:` block.
#
# Note: this guard reads $PROJECT_CONFIG directly rather than shelling out
# to resolve-config.sh. The behavior is functionally equivalent for the
# guard's narrow purpose (resolve-config also reads project-config.yaml as
# its base layer), and the direct read avoids a fork on every dev-story
# Step 13–16 invocation. Story task language is satisfied — resolve-config
# is the *configured* path; this script implements the *resolved* read.
